            <p>, a learned divine of the Lutheran persuasion, was born at Zwolle, a town of
                Overyssel, in 1718, and was a preacher in the Lutheran church at Haerlem for
                fifty-one years, where his public and private character entitled him to the highest
                esteem. His favourite motto, “<q>God is love,</q>” was the constant rule of his
                pastoral conduct. In 1752, he had the chief hand in establishing the Haerlem Society
                of Sciences, and in 1778 formed a separate branch for the study of Œconomics. In
                both he acted as secretary for many years; and, besides some Sermons, published, in
                the Transactions of that Society, a variety of scientific papers. He died at Haerlem
                in 1795.</p>

            <p>, a Danish poet, born at Wibourg in 1616, was professor of poetry at Sora, and
                afterwards lecturer in theology at Ripen, in Jutland. Among his poems are: 1. “<q>De

            <p>, lord of Someldyck and Spyck, one of the most celebrated negociators of the United
                Provinces, was the son of Cornelius Aarsens, (who was greffier, or secretary of
                state, from 1585 to 1623,) and was born at the Hague in 1572. His father put him
                under the care of Duplessis Mornay at the court of William I. prince of Orange. The
                celebrated John Barnevelt sent him afterwards as agent into France; and, after
                residing there some time, he was recognised as ambassador, the first whom the French
                Court had received in that capacity from the United States; and the king, Louis <sc>
                XIII</sc>. created him a knight and baron. After holding this office for fifteen
                years, he became obnoxious to the French Court, and was deputed to Venice, and to
                several German and Italian princes, on occasion of the troubles in Bohemia. But such
                was the dislike the French king now entertained against him, that he ordered his
                ambassadors in these courts not to receive his visits. One cause of this appears to
                have been a paper published by Aarsens in 1618, reflecting on the French king’s
                ministers. In 1620 he was sent as ambassador to England, and again in 1641: the
                object of this last embassy was to negociate a marriage between prince William, son
                to the prince of Orange, and a daughter of Charles I. Previous to this, however, we
                find him again In France, in 1624, as ambassador extraordinary, where it appears
                that he became intimate with and subservient to the cardinal Richelieu; who used to
                say that he never knew but three great politicians, Oxenstiern, chancellor of
                Sweden, Viscardi, chancellor of Montferrat, and Francis Aarsens. His character,
                however, has not escaped just censure, on account of the hand he had in the death of
                Barnevelt, and of some measures unfriendly to the liberties of his country. He died
                in 1641. The editors of the Diet. Historique attribute to him “<q date="1666">A
                Journey into Spain, historical and political,</q>” published by De Sercy at Paris, <date
                    event="work">1666</date>, 4to, and often reprinted; but this was the work of a
                grandson, of both his names, who was drowned in his passage from England to Holland,
                1659.</p>

            <p> was born at Riez in Provence, in
                1648. He removed to Paris early in life, where he was
                much admired for the brilliancy of his wit. The marechai de Luxembourg took notice
                of him, and gave him
                the title of his secretary; and the poet followed the hero
                in his campaigns. The marshal gave him his confidence during his life, and at his
                death recommended him
                to his heirs as an estimable man. The prince of Conti and
                the duke de Vendome vouchsafed him their familiarity, and
                found great pleasure in his lively and animated conversation. The witticisms which
                would have been common in
                the mouth of any other man, were rendered striking in him
                by the turn he gave them, and by the grimaces with which
                he accompanied them. A countenance remarkably ugly
                and full of wrinkles, which he managed at pleasure, stood
                him instead of a variety of masks. Whenever he read a
                tale or a comedy, he made a ludicrous use of this moveable physiognomy for
                distinguishing the personages of the
                piece he was reciting. The abbe Abeille enjoyed a priory,
                and a place in the French academy. We have of him
                some odes, some epistles, several tragedies, one comedy,
                and two operas. A certain prince observed of his tragedy
                of Cato, that, if Cato of Utica should return from the
                grave, he would be only the Cato of the abbe Abeille.
                He understood well enough what was necessary to the formation of a good poet: but he
                was not one himself. His
                style is feeble, low, and languid. In his versification he
                discovers none of that dignity he had in his character. He
                died at Paris, the 21st of May, 1718. A French critic,
                speaking of the two tragedies, Solyman and Hercules,
                written by Jean Juvenon de la Thuiilerie, says, the reader
                will be able to judge of their merit, when he is informed
                that they were attributed to the Abbé Abeille .</p>

                son of the preceding Gaspar, was born July 8, 1714. In 1731, he commenced his
                theological studies at Halberstadt, under the celebrated
                Mosheim, and a year after removed to Halle, where he
                attended the lectures of Wolfe and Baumgarten, and often
                preached with much applause. In a few years, however,
                he gave up his theological pursuits, studied medicine, and
                in 1744 was admitted to the degree of doctor at Konigsberg. On his return to
                Halberstadt, he practised as a physician above half a century, and died Nov. 23,
                1794. He
                is said to have been uncommonly successful in practice,
                yet had very little faith in medicine, and always prescribed
                such remedies as were cheap and common. Probity, modesty, and humanity, were the
                most striking features in
                his character. While studying medicine at Halle, he did
                not neglect polite literature. He made some poetical translations, particularly one
                of Juvenal into German, which he
                published in 1738 .</p>

                Bayonne, then curate of Paris, and lastly bishop of Rhodes, in 1664, which he
                resigned about three years afterwards, in order to live a retired life in the house
                of St. Lazare, at Paris. He died Oct. 4, 1691, aged 88 years. His principal works
                are: 1. “<q>Medulla Theologica,</q>” 2 vols. 12mo, which gained him the title of
                Modleuz A belli (the marrowy) from Boileau. 2. A treatise “<q>De la Hierarchic, et
                    de l'autorité du Pape,</q>” 4to. 3. “<q date="1662">La Tradition de l'Eglise,

                French writings are accounted by his countrymen flat and insipid. They allow him,

                was well skilled in grammar, poetry, philosophy, astronomy, and in medicine. He was
                also a perfect master of the Arabic. His style is in general clear, elegant,
                concise, and much like that of the Holy Scriptures; he almost always adheres to the
                literal sense, and everywhere gives proofs of his genius and good sense: he however
                advances some erroneous sentiments, and his conciseness sometimes makes his style
                obscure. He travelled in most parts of Europe, visiting England, France, Italy,
                Greece, &amp;c. for the purpose of acquiring knowledge, and far surpassed his
                brethren both in sacred and profane learning. He wrote theological, grammatical, and
                astronomical works, many of which remain in manuscript, but the following have been

            <p>, a physician and historian, was the son of Alexander Abercromby, of Fetternear, in
                Aberdeenshire, and brother of Francis Abercromby, who was created lord Glasford in
                July 1685. He was born at Forfar, in the county of Angus, in 1656, and educated in
                the university of St. Andrew’s, where he took the degree of doctor in medicine in
                1685. Some accounts say that he spent <csc>Ims</csc> youth in foreign countries, was
                probably educated in the university of Paris, and that his family were all Roman
                Catholics, who partook of the misfortunes of James <sc>II</sc>.; others, that on his
                return to Scotland he renounced the Protestant religion, at the request of king
                James, and was by him appointed one of the physicians to trie court, which he was
                obliged to relinquish at the Revolution. Soon after he attached himself to the study
                of antiquities, and published, “<q>The Martial Achievements
                    of Scotland,</q>” 2 vols. fol. 1711 and 1715, to which he was encouraged by a
                large list of subscribers. The first volume abounds in the marvellous, but the
                second is valuable on account of its accurate information respecting the British
                history in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He wrote also a treatise on Wit,
                1686, which is now little known, and translated M. Beague’s very rare book, “<q
                    date="1556">L‘Histoire de la Guerre d’Escosse,</q>” <date event="work">1556</date>,

                as in the last edition of this Dictionary, in 1726, about the age of 70, or rather
                72. </p>

            <p>, a learned Jesuit, was born in
                the diocese of Toul in Lorrain, in 1589; he entered into the
                society of Jesus in 1609, and took the fourth vow in 1623.
                He taught the belles lettres, and was made divinity professor in the university of
                Pont-a-Mousson, which place he
                enjoyed 17 years, and died Sept. 7, 1655.
            </p>
            <p>His works are 1. “<q date="1632">Commentaries on Virgil’s Æneid,</q>” printed at
                Pont-a-Mousson, <date event="work">1632</date>, 8vo; and again at Toulouse, 1644; at
                Rouen, 1637 and 1648. 2. “<q date="1631">Commentary on the third volume of Cicero’s
                Orations,</q>” Paris, <date event="work">1631</date>, 2 vols. fol. His Analyses of
                the Orations were published separately at Pont-a-Mousson, 1633, 4to. 3. “<q>Pharus
                Veteris Testament!, sive sacrarum questionum libri <sc>XV</sc>.</q>” Paris, 1648,
                fol. This is the most esteemed of his works. 4. “<q date="1623">Nonni Neopolitani
                paraphrasis sancti secundum Joannem Evangelii. Accesserunt notse P. N. A. soc. Jes.</q>”
                Paris, <date event="work">1623</date>, 8vo. These notes were from the pen of our
                author. He published also a Hebrew grammar in Latin verse, and translated into
                French Bartoli’s Italian pieces, “<q>The Life of Vinant Caraffa;</q>” “<q>The Man of
                Letters,</q>” and “<q>Contented Poverty.</q>” As an original writer he is uncommonly
                prolix, but displays much learning and acuteness. Bayle gives most praise to his
                commentary on Cicero, by which Osorius and Olivet profited much; but others prefer
                his Pharus. It may be necessary to add what is meant by bis taking the fourth vow.
                In addition to the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, the fourth is, that the
                person taking it shall labour to promote the salvation of others, by instructing
                youth, preaching, administering the sacraments, and by becoming missionaries among
                heretics and idolaters.</p>

            <p> was of an illustrious family, being descended on the father’s side from Justin,
                nephew to Justinian emperor of Constantinople, and also from the dukes of Athens,
                Bohemia, and Corinth. His ancestors bad enjoyect very honourable posts in the
                kingdom of Naples, and had also been viceroys of Sicily, and generals. Some of them
                had filled very high employments in the republic of Florence, had been ambassadors
                to several powers of Europe, were related to all the princes of the Morea and
                adjacent islands, raised to the dignity orcardinal; and had erected several splendid
                Carthusian monasteries in Florence, Naples, &amp;c. Our author, the son of Neri
                Acciaioli and Lena Strozzi, was born at Florence in 1428. His first preceptors were
                James Ammanati, afterwards cardinal of Pavia, and Leonard d'Arezzo. He afterwards
                studied Greek under Argyropilus, and became one of the first Greek scholars of his
                time. He was one of the celebrated literary parties at which Lorenzo de Me.lici
                presided. Excelling in rhetoric, philosophy, and mathematics, he would have attained
                a very high rank in the republic of letters, if his weak state of health, and the
                part he took in the affairs of his country, had not interrupted his studies. He
                filled several employments in the state, and gave universal satisfaction. In 1475 he
                was gonfalonier, or ensign of the republic, and died in 1478 at Milan, when on his
                way to Paris as ambassador from the Florentines. This circumstance was a subject of
                the sincerest grief to the Florentines, who well knew how to appreciate the virtues
                of their fellow-citizens, and omitted no opportunity of inciting the patriotism of
                the living, by the honours they bestowed on the memory of the dead. A sumptuous
                funeral was decreed to his remains, which were brought to Florence for that purpose.
                Lorenzo de Medici and three other eminent citizens were appointed curators of his
                children, and the daughters had considerable portions assigned them from the public
                treasury. The celebrated Angelo Politian wrote his epitaph, and Christopher Landino
                pronounced the funeral oration. His works are: 1. “<q date="1478">Expositio super
                libros Ethicorum Aristotelis, in novam
                    traductionem Argyropili,</q>” Florence, <date event="work">1478</date>, fol. 2.

                1566</date>, 8vo. 3. In the Latin translation of Plutarch, he translated the lives
                of Alcibiades and Demetrius, and added to the same collection those of Hannibal and
                Scipio from his own pen, with a life of Charlemagne. 4. “<q date="1473">The Latin

            <p>, probably of the same family with the preceding, was born at Florence in 1461, and
                having been banished in his infancy with his relations, was recalled when about 16
                years of age by Lorenzo the magnificent, and educated by his directions with
                Lorenzo, the son of Pier-Francesco de Medici, to whom Zanobio was nearly related. He
                became very eminent as a Greek and Latin scholar, and had much intercourse with
                Angelo Politian, Marsilius Ficinus, and other eminent Florentine scholars. After the
                death of Lorenzo the magnificent, he became disgusted with the commotions which
                agitated his native place, and devoting himself to a monastic life, received fiom
                the famous Savonarola, about 1494, the habit of a Dominican. At this time he studied
                Hebrew with great industry; but his chief employment was the examination of the
                Greek manuscripts in the library of the Medici, and in that of St. Mark at Florence.
                On the elevation of Leo X. he went to Rome, and was enrolled by Leo among his
                constant attendants, with an honourable stipend, and a residence in the oratory of
                S. Silvestro. In 1518 Leo appointed him librarian to the Vatican, where he undertook
                the laborious task of selecting and arranging the ancient public documents, of which
                he formed an index, published since by Montfaucon, in his Bibl. Biblio-ithecarum <csc>
                Mss</csc>. vol. I. p. 202. His industry probably shortened his days, as he did not
                long enjoy his office, having died July 27, 1519, and not 1536, as Fabricius
                asserts. Saxius gives 1520 as the date. </p>
            <p>While attending a general chapter of his order at Naples in 1515, he made an oration
                in Latin in praise of the city of Naples, which he afterwards published. He also
                translated into Latin, Eusebius of Caesarea, Olympiodorus, and Theodoret, and is
                supposed to have been the translator of the greater part of the works of Justin
                Martyr. Among his remaining works is an oration in praise of the city of Rome,
                printed in 4to, without place, printer, or date; but the dedication to the cardinal
                Julio de Medici is dated 26 May 1518. In 1495 he published Politian’s Greek
                epigrams, which were recommended to his care by the author in his last moments. He
                translated also into Latin verse the Greek address of Marcus Musurus to Leo X.
                prefixed to the first edition of Plato. Giraldi, in his first dialogue “<q>De Poetis
                nostrorum temporum,</q>” admits him among the good poets of his age; and others have
                bestowed great applause on his verses, a specimen of which may be seen in the work

            <p>, an eminent lawyer and historian of the fifteenth century, and the first of that
                ancient Tuscan family who acquired a name for literary talents, was born at Arezzo,
                in 1415. His father was Michel Accolti, a civilian of Florence, and his mother a
                daughter of Roselli of Arezzo, also a lawyer. After a classical education, he
                studied the civil law, and was made professor at Florence, where his opinions
                acquired him much popularity. The Florentines, after conferring on him the rights of
                citizenship, chose him in 1459 to be secretary of the republic, in the room of
                Poggius, which office he retained until his death in 1466. The account of his
                transactions in public affairs are preserved in four books, with a great collection
                of his letters to foreign princes, which evince his sagacity as a statesman, and his
                politeness as a writer. He married Laura Frederigi, the daughter of a lawyer and
                patrician of Florence, by whom he had a numerous family, of whom Bernard and Peter
                will be noticed hereafter. His memory is said to have been so retentive, that on one
                occasion, after hearing the Hungarian ambassador pronounce a Latin address to the
                magistrates of Florence, he repeated the whole word for word. -His inclination for
                the Study of history made him relax in the profession of the law, and produced: 1. “<q

                at Basle, Venice, and Florence, the latter edition with notes by Thomas Dempster,
                1623, 4to, and at Groninguen, by Henry Hoffnider, 1731, 8vo. It was also translated
                into Italian, by Francis Baldelli, and printed at Venice, 1549, 8vo. Yves Duchat of
                Troyes in Champagne, translated it into French and Greek, and printed it at Paris,
                1620, 8vo. This is a work of considerable historical credit, and in the succeeding
                century, served as a guide to TorquatoTasso, in his immortal poem, the Gerusalemme
                liberata. It was dedicated to Piero de Medici, and not to Cosmo, as Moreri asserts.
                Paulo Cortesi, a severe censor, allows that it is a work of great industry, and that
                it throws considerable light on a very difficult subject. A more recent critic
                objects to the purity of his style, and the length of the speeches he puts in the
                mouths of his principal personages. 2. “<q date="1689">De praestantia

            <p>, the brother of Benedetto, and usually called <csc>Francis</csc> D'<csc>Arezzo</csc>,
                or <csc>Aretin</csc>, from the place of his birth, was born in 1418. The celebrated
                Francis Philelphus was his preceptor in polite learning; after which he studied law
                under the ablest professors, and became himself one of their number, teaching that
                faculty at Bologna, Ferrara, and Sienna. He was for five years secretary to the duke
                of Milan, and died of the stone at the baths of Sienna, in 1483. He has been
                accused, but without proof, of the grossest avarice. If he left vast wealth, it was
                owing to the profits of his profession, of which he was acknowledged to be the
                ablest and most successful practitioner. A journey which he made to Rome, when
                Sixtus <sc>IV</sc>. was Pope, has given rise to another story, equally without
                proof, that he solicited to be made Cardinal, which the Pope refused, on pretence of
                the injury that would accrue to learning from such a promotion. Another story is
                recorded, more to his honour. While professor of law at Ferrara, he had occasion to
                lecture to his scholars on the advantages of a character known for probity and
                honour; and, in order to exemplify his doctrine, he went in the night, accompanied
                by only one servant, broke open the butchers’ stalls, and took away some pieces. The
                law-students were immediately suspected of the robbery, and two of them, of
                indifferent character, were imprisoned. The Professor then went before the Duke,
                demanded their release, and accused himself: having proved the fact, which was with
                difficulty believed, he took the opportunity to show the advantage of a good
                character, and the dangers of a bad one.</p>
            <p>He left several works. The principal are 1. “<q date="1470">S. Chrysostomi homilias
                    in Evangelium- S. Joannis, interprete F.A.</q>” Rome, <date event="work">1470</date>,
                fol. Erasmus is of opinion that this translation is deficient in fidelity, anJ that
                the author was not sufficiently acquainted with the Greek language. 2. “<q

                the author of it. 5. “<q>Consilia seu Responsa,</q>” Pisa, a collection of
                consultations on questions of law. 6. “<q>Commentaria super Lib. <sc>II</sc>.

                Crescembini inserted some of his sonnets in his history of Italian poetry. His Latin

                Cardinal, under the title of St. Eusebius, hut is better known by the title of

                and Italy; and attained the higher honours of cardinal-vicar and legate. He died at
                Rome Dec. 12, 1532, aged 77; and left some works on law of no great importance. He
                was the author of the bull against Luther, which condemned forty-one propositions or
                that reformer. One of his natural sons, Benedict Accolti, was, in 1564j the chief of

            <p>, an eminent lawyer, who first collected the various opinions and decisions of his
                predecessors, in the Roman law, into one body, was born at Florence, in 1151, or,
                according to some writers, in 1182. He was the scholar of Azzo, and soon became more
                celebrated than his master. Yet it is thought that he did not begin the study of law
                before he was forty years old. When professor at Bologna, he resigned his office in
                order to complete a work on the explanation of the laws, which he had long
                meditated, and in which he was now in danger of being anticipated by Odefroy. By
                dint of perseverance for seven years, he accumulated the vast collection known by
                the title of the “<q>Great Gloss,</q>” or the “<q>Continued Gloss</q>” of Accursius.
                He may be considered as the first of glossators, and as the last, since no one has
                attempted the same, unless his son Cervot, whose work is not in much esteem; but he
                was deficient in a proper knowledge of the Greek and Roman historians, and the
                science of coins, inscriptions, and antiquities, which are frequently necessary in
                the explanation of the Roman law. On this account, he was as much undervalued by the
                learned lawyers of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, as praised by those of
                the twelfth and thirteenth, who named him the Idol of Lawyers. They even established
                it as a principle, that the authority of the Glosses should be universally received,
                and that they should rally round this perpetual standard of truth. The different
                studies pursued in the ages of Accursius’ friends and enemies, will account for
                their different opinions of his merits; the one consisted of accumulated learning,
                interpretation, and commentary, the other approached nearer to nature and facts, by
                adding the study of antiquities, and of the Greek and Latin historians. Another
                reason probably was, that Accursius, who has been careless in his mode of quotation,
                became blamed for many opinions which belong to Irnerius, Hugolinus, Martinus
                Bulgarus, Aldericus, Pileus, &amp;c. and others his predecessors, whose sentiments
                he has not accurately distinguished. The best edition of his great work is that of
                Denis Godefroi, Lyons, 1589, 6 vols. fol, Of his private life we have no important
                materials. He lived in splendour at a magnificent palace at Bologna, or at his villa
                in the country; and died in his 78th year, in 1229. Those who fix his death in 1260
                confound him with one of his sons of the same name. All his family, without
                exception, studied the law; and he had a daughter, a lady of great learning, who
                gave public lectures ou the Roman law in the university of Bologna. Bayle doubts
                this; but it is confirmed by Pancirollus, Fravenlobius, and Paul Freyer. The tomb of
                Accursius, in the church of the Cordeliers at Bologna, is remarkable only for the
                simplicity of his epitaph “<q>Sepnlchrum Accursii glossatoris legum, et Francisci
                ejus filii.</q>”</p>

            <p>, a learned Prussian divine, was born at Geneva in 1696, took orders in 1722, and in
                1724 was promoted to the church of Werder in Berlin. He enjoyed the protection of
                the prince-royal of Prussia; and having in 1730 accompanied the son of M. de
                Finkenstein to Geneva, was admitted into the society of pastors. Eight years after,
                the king of Prussia appointed him counsellor of the supreme consistory, and in 1740,
                a member of the French directory, with the title of Privy-counsellor. Having been
                received into the academy of Berlin in 1743, he was also appointed inspector of the
                French college, and director of the Charity-house. He died in 1772. He was long the
                correspondent of the Jesuits Colonia, Tournemine, Hardouin, Poreus, and of father Le
                Long, and Turretine, Trouchin, and Vernet of Geneva. He often preached before the
                royal family of Prussia; and such were his powers of oratory, that a celebrated
                French comedian at Berlin, who there taught the theatrical art, recommended his
                pupils to hear Achard. He was of a very feeble constitution, and for twenty years
                subsisted entirely on a milk-diet. In the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, for
                1745, there is the outline of a very considerable work, in which he proves the
                liberty of the human mind against Spinosa, Bayle, and Collins. Two volumes of “<q>Sermons
                sur divers textes de l'Ecriture Sainte,</q>” were published at Berlin after his
                death. </p>
            <p>His son <csc>Francis</csc>, born at Berlin in 1753, a member of several academies,
                has furnished many dissertations for the Literary Journal of Berlin, and other
                Memoirs of learned societies. Senebier in his literary history of Geneva gives a
                list of all his pieces, and a collection of them was published in German, in two
                volumes.</p>

            <p> was born at Avignon, Jan. 29, 1679, of a noble and ancient family. After having
                embraced the ecclesiastical profession, he became not only distinguished by the
                excellence of his doctrines, but particularly by his charitable exertions during the
                plague in 1721; and his subsequent promotions had no other effect on him than to
                increase his zeal and his piety. Pope Clement <sc>XII</sc>. informed of his talents
                and conciliating spirit, employed him in the capacity of apostolic vicar, to settle
                the disgraceful disputes that had arisen among the missionaries of China. Achards,
                who was then bishop of Halicarnassus, undertook this commission; and after a tedious
                voyage of two years, and two years’ resi-r dence in China, where he ineffectually
                laboured to accomplish the object of his mission, died at Cochin, April 2, 1741, a
                martyr to his indefatigable and benevolent zeal. The Abbe Fab re, his secretary,
                published an account of this mission, entitled “<q>Lettres edifiantes et
                curieusessurla

            <p>, an eminent painter,
                was born at Cologne, in 1556, of a good family. He
                discovered a taste for his art from his earliest years, and at
                the age of eleven, painted a portrait with such success, as
                to induce his parents to encourage his studies. After having been for some time
                taught by a very indifferent painter, he became the disciple of de Georges, or
                Jerrigh, a
                good portrait-painter, with whom he remained six years;
                and afterwards improved himself by studying and copying
                the works of Spranger. In his twenty-second year he went
                to Italy, and was introduced at Venice to a Flemish artist,
                named Gaspard Reims. This man no sooner learned that
                Van Achen was a German, than he recommended him to
                an Italian who courted necessitous artists that he might
                make, a trade of their labours. With him Van Achen
                made some copies, but, being unable to forget the reception which Reims had given
                him, he painted his own portrait, and sent it to him. Reims was so struck with the
                performance, that he apologized to Van Achen, took him
                into his house, and preserved the portrait all his life with
                great veneration. At Venice, he acquired the Venetian
                art of colouring, and thence went to Rome to improve his
                design, but never quitted the mannered forms of Spranger.
                His best performances at Rome were a Nativity for the
                church of the Jesuits, and a portrait of Madona Venusta,
                a celebrated performer on the lute. His talents, however,
                and polite accomplishments, recommended him to several
                of the greatest princes of Europe, and particularly to the
                elector of Bavaria, and the emperor Rodolph, by both of
                whom he was patronized and honoured. He was one of
                that set of artists who, in the lapse of the sixteenth century, captivated Germany
                and its princes by the introduction of a new style, or rather manner, grossly
                compounded from the principles of the Florentine and Venetian schools. He died at
                Prague in 1621.</p>

            <p>, a native of Bologna, where he was born Oct. 29, 1463, was a philosopher and
                physician, and professed both those sciences with great reputation. He had scholars
                from all parts of Europe. He died in his own country, August 2, 1512, at the age of
                40, with the surname of The great philosopher, after having published various pieces
                in anatomy and medicine. To him is ascribed the discovery of the little bones in the
                organ of hearing'. He adopted the sentiments of Averroes, and was the rival of
                Pomponacius. These two philosophers mutually decried each other, and Pomponacius had
                generally the advantage, as he had the talent of mixing witticisms with his
                arguments, for the entertainment of the by-standers, while Achillini lowered himself
                with the public by his singular and slovenly dress. His philosophical works were
                printed in one vol. folio, at Venice, in 1508, and reprinted with considerable
                additions in 1545, 1551, and 1568. His principal medical works are: 1. “<q
                    date="1520">Annotationes Anatomies,</q>” Bonon. <date event="work">1520</date>,
                4to, and Venice, 1521, 8vo. 2. “<q date="1521">De humani corporis Anatomia,</q>”

                the collection published on the death of the poet Seraphin dall' Aquila, not with
                much success.</p>

            <p>, younger brother of the preceding, was born at Bologna in 1466, where he died in
                1558. He was learned in the Greek and Latio languages, in theology, philosophy, and
                music, and the study of law and antiquities, but is most celebrated as a poet,
                although his works are not free from the faults peculiar to his age. Yet he gave
                even these a turn so peculiarly original, that they appear to have been rather his
                own than acquired by imitation. He published, among many other works: 1. A
                scientific and moral poem, written in the ottava rima, entitled “<q>
                    <sc>II</sc> Viridario,</q>” Bologna, 4to, which contains eulogiums on many of
                his learned contemporaries. 2. “<q>
                    <sc>II</sc> Fedele,</q>” also in heroics. These are both scarce, as they never
                were reprinted. 3. “<q>Annotazioni della lingua volgare,</q>” Bologna, 1.536, 8vo.
                This was intended as an answer to those who complained of the provincialisms in his
                style. 4. He also published a collection of poems pu the death of Seraphin dall'
                Aquila, mentioned in the preceding article, Bologna, 1504, 4to. He has more stretch

                he entered on the study of the law, and prosecuted it with so much success, that he
                was honoured with a doctor’s degree at the age of twenty, Dec. 16, 1594, and became
                a professor of that science at Bologna, Ferrara, and Parma, where he acquired great
                reputation. His learning was so much admired that an inscription to his honour was
                put up in the public schools, and both popes and cardinals gave him hopes, which
                were never realized, of making his fortune. Towards the end of his life he lived
                principally in a country house called <sc>II</sc> Sasso, and died there Oct. 1,
                1640. His body was carried to Bologna, and interred in the tomb of his ancestors in
                the church of St. Martin. He is principally known now by his poetry, in which he was
                an imitator of Marino, and with much of the bad taste of his age. It has been
                asserted that he received a gold chain worth a thousand crowns from the court of
                France, for a poem on the conquests of Louis <sc>XIII</sc>.; but this reward was
                sent him by the Cardinal Richelieu, in consequence of some verses he wrote on the
                birth of the dauphin. His poems were printed at Bologna, 1632, 4to, and were

            <p>, a physician and medical writer of considerable note in Germany, and professor of
                medicine at Altdorf, in Franconia, was born in 1756, at Zeulenrode, in Upper Saxony.
                His father was a physician, and initiated his son in that science at a very early
                age. When scarcely fifteen, he prescribed with success to many of his friends daring
                a dangerous epidemic which prevailed at Otterndorf. He afterwards finished his
                studies at Jena and Gottingen, under Baldinger, and became a very excellent
                classical scholar under the celebrated Heyne. After having practised medicine in his
                own country for some years, and distinguished himself by various translations of
                Italian, French, and English works, as well as by his original compositions, he was
                appointed to the professorship at Altdorf. He was also a member of various medical
                societies; and his practice is said to have been as successful, as his theory of
                disease was sound. He died at Altdorf in 1801. His principal works are: 1. “<q>Institutiones
                Historiae Medicinse,</q>” Nuremberg, 17.'J2, 8vo. 2. “<q>A Manual of Military
                Medicine,</q>” 2 vols. 8vo, Leipsic, 1794—95, in German. 3. “<q date="1781">The Life

            <p>, a learned Orientalist, and professor of divinity at Breslaw, was born at Bernstadt,
                March 6, 1654. It is said that, at six years of age, he could speak Hebrew. He died
                Nov. 4, 1704. His most celebrated works are some chapters of a polyglot Koran, which
                he intended to have completed. The specimen, which is very scarce, is “<q
                    date="1701">Tetrapla Alcoranica, sive Specimen Alcorani quadrilinguis Arabici,
                Persici, Turcici, et
                    Latini,</q>” Berlin, <date event="work">1701</date>, fol. He published also, “<q
                    date="1680">Obadias
                    Armenus et Latinus, cum annotationibus,</q>” Leipsic, <date event="work">1680</date>,
                4to. In printing this work, in which he followed as his guides Ambrose Theseus and
                Francis Rivoli, he was obliged to have the Armenian types cast at his own expence.
                He corresponded with many learned contemporaries, as Longuerue, Spanheim, and
                Leibnitz, who, however, did not approve his notion of the Armenian being the ancient
                language of Egypt.</p>

            <p>, a Spanish Jesuit and missionary, was born at Burgos, 1597. He w^s sent on a mission
                to the American Indians, and on his return in the year 1641, published in Spanish,
                by permission of the king, “<q>Nuevo Descubrimiento del gran rio de las Amazones,</q>”
                4to; but the projects expected from his discoveries respecting this river, were
                discountenanced afterwards by the house of Braganza, and Philip <sc>IV</sc>. ordered
                all the copies of this curious work to be destroyed, so that for many years two only
                were known to exist; one in the Vatican library, and another in the possession of
                Marin Leroi de Gomberville, who translated it into French, and published it, under
                the title of “<q date="1682">Relation de la riviere des
                    Amazones,</q>” Paris, <date event="work">1682</date>, 2 vols. 12mo, with a
                curious dissertation; but some passages of the text are not very faithfully
                translated. This was afterwards reprinted in the second volume of Wood’s Rogers’ s
                Voyage round the world. Acuna went to the East Indies some time after the
                publication of his work, and is supposed to have died at Lima about or soon after
                1675.</p>

            <p>, a French translator of some note, was
                born at Vendome in 1663, and after finishing his studies,
                entered into the service of the prince of Conti, who appointed him to be his
                secretary. He was elected into
                the French academy in 1723, in room of the abbe Fleury.
                He translated part of De Thou’s history, which has London on the title, but was
                printed at Paris, 1734, 16 vols,
                4to. This he undertook with Charles Le Beau, the abbes
                Mascrier, Le Due, Fontaines, Prevost, and father Fabre.
                He translated also the memoirs of Montecuculli, Amsterdam, 1734, 12mo; an account of
                the cardinal Tournon;
                Atheneus; and other works. He died Nov. 12, 1735.</p>

            <p>, brother of the preceding, and likewise an eminent artist, was born at Nancy, March
                22, 1705. He studied under his father at Paris, and in 1726 went to Rome. Two years
                after he gained one of the prizes of the academy of St. Luke. At this time his
                brother, the subject of the preceding article, and Francis, a younger brother, were
                at Rome, and assisted each other in their labours. After a residence of nine years,
                he returned to Paris, and with some opposition was admitted into the academy, where
                he exhibited his model of “<q>Prometheus,</q>” but did not execute it until long
                after. Next year he executed the “<q>martyrdom of St. Victoria,</q>” a bas-relief in
                bronze, for the royal chapel at Versailles. For some time he assisted his brother in
                “<q>the Neptune;</q>” but, a disagreement occurring, quitted this, and employed
                himself at the hotel Soubise, the chamber of accounts, and the abbey of St. Dennis.
                He was a candidate for the mausoleum of the cardinal de Fleury, and the public
                adjudged him the prize; but Lemoyne was employed. The tomb of the queen of Poland,
                wife of Stanislaus, is esteemed one of his best works. His Prometheus was finished
                in 1763, and the king of Prussia offered him 30,000 franks for it; but Adam said it
                was executed for his master, and no longer his own property. He died March 27, 1778,
                in his 75th year. His merits as a sculptor have been thought equal to those of his
                brother. It is said to have been his constant prayer that he might be neither the
                first northe last in his art, but attain an honourable middle rank, as the surest
                way to avoid jealousy on the one hand, or contempt on the other; and his last
                biographer thinks his prayer was heard. The younger brother, <csc>Francis</csc>-<csc>
                Gaspard</csc>, exercised his profession as a sculptor for some years with
                considerable reputation, and obtained a prize from the French academy, but no
                important works of his are mentioned; he died at Paris in 1759.</p>

                republic, where he resided twelve years. On his return to France, he published his
                various elementary treatises, which have been much approved by teachers. 1. “<q

            <p>, an Italian poet, a descendant from the ancient family of Adimari, at Florence; was

                each, under the names of six of the muses: Terpsichore, Clio, Melpomene, Calliope,
                Urania, and Polyhymnia, which partake of the bad taste of his age, in forced
                sentiments and imagery; but he was an accomplished scholar in the Greek and Latin
                languages. His translation of Pindar, “<q date="1631">Ode di Pindaro, tradotte da

                valued for the notes, as the author has been very unfortunate in transfusing the

                beloved for his talents and accomplishments. He received from the duke Ferdinand
                Charles of Mantua, the title of marquis, and gentleman of his chamber. He was also
                member of the academy of Florence, of De la Crnsca, and many other learned
                societies. He succeeded the famous Redi as professor of the Tuscan language in the
                academy of Florence, and was likewise professor of chivalry in that of the nobles,
                in which science his lectures, which he illustrated with apposite passages from
                ancient and modern history, were highly esteemed. These were never printed, but
                manuscript copies are preserved in several of the libraries of Florence. His only
                prose work, a collection of religious pieces, was published at Florence, 1706, small
                4to, under the title “<q>Prose sacre.</q>” His poetry consists of: 1. “<q>Sonnets
                    and other lyric pieces,</q>” and among them, a collection of Odes or Canzoni,
                dedicated to Louis <sc>XIV</sc>, and magnificently printed at Florence, 1693. 2.

                but meeting with some unpleasant circumstances there, he went to Rome, where he
                spent five years in amassing materials for the works which he afterwards wrote. On
                his return he was employed by Remi, archbishop of Lyons, in his diocese, and was
                elected archbishop of Vienne in the year 860. His vigilance over his clergy, his
                care in the instruction of his flock, his frequent visitations throughout his
                province, and the humility and purity of his private life, distinguished him in an

                affairs of state, when, he gave his opinion, and urged his remonstrances with
                firmness and independence. He died Dec. 16, 875. He is the author of, 1. “<q>An
                Universal Chronicle,</q>” from the creation of the world, which has been often cited
                as authority for the early history of France. It was printed at Paris, 1512, 1522,
                fol. 156], 8vo; and at Rome, 1745, fol. 2. “<q>A Martyrology,</q>” better arranged

            <p>, the son of the preceding, was born in 1513, or, as some say, 1511, and died at
                Florence in 1579. In his youth, he carried arms in defence of the liberties of his
                country, and afterwards devoted his time to study. For thirty years he taught
                rhetoric in the university of Florence, and enjoyed the friendship of the most
                celebrated of his contemporaries, Annibal Caro, Varchi, Flaminio, and the cardinals
                Bembo and Contarini. His chief work, which forms a continuation of Guicciardini, is
                the history of his own time, entitled “<q date="1536">Deir Istoria de' suoi tempi,</q>”
                from <date event="work">1536</date> to 1574. Florence, 1583, fol. This is a most
                scarce edition, and more valued than that of Venice, 1587, 3 vols. 4to. The abbé
                Lenglet du Fresnoy, Bayle, and particularly Thuanus, who has derived much assistance
                from this work, speak highly of his correctness as a historian. He had the best
                materials, and among others, some memoirs furnished by the grand duke of Tuscany,
                Cosmo I. who advised him to the undertaking. He is said to have written funeral
                orations on the grand duke, on Charles V. and the emperor Ferdinand; but we know
                only of his oration on the grand duchess, Jane of Austria, which was translated from
                Latin into Italian, and published at Florence in 1579, 4to. In 1567 he published “<q>Lettera
                a Giorgio Vasari sopra gli
                    antichi Pittori nominati da Plinio,</q>” 4to. This letter, oa the ancient
                painters mentioned by Pliny, which is rather a treatise on painting, is inserted by
                Vasari in the second volume of his lives of the painters. Vasari speaks of him as an
                enlightened amateur of the fine arts, and one whose advice was of much importance to
                him when he was employed at Florence in the palace of the grand duke.</p>

            <p>, sonof the preceding, born in 1533, was so distinguished for his studies, as to
                obtain, when very young, the professorship of rhetoric which his father held in the
                university of Florence. So our authority; but there seems to be some mistake in this
                date, as he could not be very young when he succeeded his father as professor of
                rhetoric, if his father filled that chair for the space of thirty years. He was,
                however, a member of the academy of Florence, and published his father’s history.
                His own works are, 1. An Italian translation of “<q>Demetrius
                    Phalereus</q>” on eloquence, which he left in manuscript, and which was not
                published until 1738, by Antony Francis Gori, who prefixed a long account of the
                life and writings of the translator; 2. Two Lectures on the “<q>Education of
                    the Florentine Nobility,</q>” printed in the “<q>Prose Fiorentine,</q>” vol. <sc>
                IV</sc>. He also translated Plutarch’s Morals, not yet published, but much commended
                by Ammirato and others. There are two copies in the Laurentian library; Adrian died
                in 1604.</p>

                After applying to his studies with much assiduity, he was ordained priest in 1561,
                and was director of the nuns of St. Barbara until the civil wars obliged him to take
                refuge first at Mecklin, then at Maestricht, and lastly at Cologne, where he died,
                June 20, 1585. He published “<q date="1578">Vita Jesu Christi, ex quatuor
                evangelistis breviter contexta,</q>” Antwerp, <date event="work">1578</date>, 12mo;
                but the work for which he is best known is his “<q>Theatrum Terra; Sanctse,</q>” or,
                history of the Holy Land, illustrated with maps, and printed in 1590, 1595, 1600,
                1628, and 1682, foL; a proof of the esteem in which it was long held, although his
                authorities are thought to be sometimes exceptionable. The second part, which
                contains a description of Jerusalem, was printed by the author in 1584, and was
                reprinted after his death in 1588, and 1592, 8vo. He sometimes took the name of
                Christianus Crucius, in allusion to his banishment and sufferings.</p>

            <p>, a lawyer, was born at Antwerp in 1486. He was educated under the care of the
                celebrated Erasmus, with whom he lived afterwards in close friendship, as he did
                with the illustrious sir Thomas More, and other eminent scholars of that age. More
                introduces him in the prologue to his Utopi with high praise, as “<q>a
                    man there in his country of honest reputation, and also preferred to high
                promotions, worthy truly of the highest.
                    For it is hard to say whether the young man be in learning
                    or in honesty more excellent. For he is both of wonderful virtuous conditions,
                and also singularly well learned,
                    and towards all sorts of people exceeding gentle.</q>” Sir Thomas adds, that “<q>the
                charms of his conversation abated
                    the fervent desire he had to see his native country, from
                    which sir Thomas had been absent more than four months.</q>” He occurs also with
                high praise in the life and writings of Erasmus. In 1510, on the death of Adrian
                Blict, first notary at Antwerp, he was unanimously elected into his place. He died
                Nov. 29, 1533. His works are, 1. “<q date="1519">Threnodiain
                    funus Maximiliani Caesaris, cum Epitaphiis aliquot et Epigrammatum libello,</q>”

            <p>, a Dutch painter,
                born at Delft in 1602, acquired a great reputation by his
                delicate manner of painting fruit, still life, and dead game.
                He was exact in copying every thing after nature, disposing them with elegance, and
                finishing his pictures with
                neatness, and transparency of colour. Whether he painted dead game, fruit, helmets
                with plumes of feathers, or
                vases of gold and silver, to each he gave a true and striking
                resemblance of nature, and an extraordinary lustre to the
                gold, silver, and steel. He died in 1658.</p>

            <p>, was the nephew and disciple of the preceding, born at Delft in 1620, and arrived at
                a much higher degree of perfection than his instructor. In his youth he went to
                France, and exercised his art there for four years, and afterwards to Rome, where he
                resided for seven years; and in both places was encouraged by the patronage of
                persons of the first distinction. In 1656, he returned to his own country, and
                settled at Amsterdam, where his pictures were highly valued, and sold at a very
                great price. Some of them are still in the collections of the amateurs of that city.
                Van Aelst knew his own merit, and would not submit to disrespect. On one occasion
                when a burgomaster of Amsterdam gave him a very haughty answer in a matter of some
                importance to him, he opened his breast and shewed him a gold chain and medal which
                the grand duke of Tuscany had given him, adding, “<q>You came into the world with a
                sack of money, that is all your merit as to mine, it is in
                    my talents.</q>” Like his uncle he employed himself chiefly on still life, and
                his pencil was so light, and his touch so delicate, that the objects he painted
                seemed real. He died in 1679.</p>

            <p>, a nobleman, born at Venice in 1481, carried arms in his youth, and was taken
                prisoner. On his release he made a vow to dedicate his life to the care of orphans,
                and accordingly collected a considerable number of them in a house, where they were
                educated in virtue and industry. This laid the foundation of the regular clerks of
                St. Maieul, who are also called the fathers of Somasquo, from the place where he
                first established their community. They were afterwards successively confirmed by
                the popes Paul <sc>III</sc>. and Pius <sc>IV</sc>. Their chief occupation was to
                instruct young persons in the principles of the Christian religion, and particularly
                orphans. He appears to have been a man of a most humane disposition; and in 1528,
                when plague and famine raged in Italy, he sold even his furniture to assist the
                poor. He died in 1537, and was admitted into the number of saints by Benedict <sc>

                had fled on account of his attachment to the Protestant religion. He studied first
                at Aix-la-Chapelle, and afterwards at Juliers under Kunius, and at Dort under Adrian
                Marcellus, and Gerard Vossius. At Leyden, he attended the lectures of Baudius, and
                spent four years in visiting the foreign universities. On his return, in 1615, he
                succeeded Vossius as rector of the college at Dort. At Utrecht he was, some years
                after, appointed professor of history; the subjects of the lectures which he gave
                for above twenty-six years, were taken from Tacitus. He was a firm supporter of the
                Cartesian philosophy, and refused to have any hand in the proceedings of the

            <p>, a German physician of considerable eminence, was born at Rostock, Dec. 13, 1724,
                and died at Dorpt, in Livonia, Aug. 1802. He is best known to the learned world by
                his “<q>Tentamen theoriae Electricitatis et Magnetismi,</q>” Petersburgh, 4to; of
                which M. Haiiy published an abridgement and analysis, Paris, 1787, 8vo. In 1762 he
                also published “<q>Reflections on the distribution of Heat on the sur-&lt;
                    face of the Earth,</q>” translated afterwards into French by Raoult de Rouen,
                and wrote several papers in the memoirs of the academy of Petersburgh. He was
                likewise among the first who made correct experiments on the electricity of the
                tourmalin, and published the result in a small volume, 8vo, Petersburgh, 1762. His
                reputation has been much greater on the continent, than among the philosophers of
                our country; probably owing to the very slight and almost unintelligible account
                which Dr. Priestley has given of his “<q>Tentamen,</q>” in his history of
                Electricity. The hon. Mr. Cavendish has done it more justice in the Philosophical
                Transactions, vol. <sc>LXI</sc>, where his own excellent dissertation is an
                extensive and accurate explanation of JEpinus’s theory. But a more elaborate

            <p>, a fellow-labourer with Luther in promoting the Reformation, was born 1499, in the
                Marche of
                Brandenburgh. His family name was Huch, or Hsech,
                which he changed to Æpinus, a custom very common with
                the learned men of his time. He was originally a Franciscan friar, and entered that
                society when in England; but
                on his return to Germany he studied under Luther, whose
                religious principles he adopted, and propagated with zeal,
                first at Stralsund, and afterwards at Hamburgh, where, as
                pastor of the church of St. Peter, and ecclesiastical inspector, he obtained great
                influence. In 1547, when
                Charles V. endeavoured to obtrude the Interim on the Protestants, after he had
                defeated their forces, and after the
                death of Luther, he opposed this species of formulary, or
                confession of faith, so called because it was only to take
                place in the interim, until a general council should decide
                all the points in question between the Protestants and Catholics. It indeed
                satisfied neither party, and the Lutheran
                preachers refused to subscribe to it. Those who did subscribe got the name of
                adiaphorists, or indifferent or lukewarm persons, against whom Æpinus contended,
                both in
                the pulpit and press. He died May 13, 1553, leaving several works, of which Melchior
                Adam has given the subjects, but no notice of the dates, or proper titles. In
                learning, zeal, and intrepid spirit, he was equal to most of
                his contemporaries who opposed the church of Rome.</p>

            <p>, called by the Italians PietroLongo,
                from his tallness, was a celebrated painter, and born at Amsterdam in 1519. His
                father, who was a stocking-maker,
                had intended to train him in his own way; but-the mother,
                finding in him an inclination towards painting, was resolved
                that her son should pursue his genius, even though she always were forced to spin
                for her livelihood: and to this her
                husband at length consented. His first master was Alart
                Claessen, an eminent painter in Amsterdam, under whom
                he so distinguished himself, that he soon engaged the attention of the great. When
                he was about eighteen, he
                went to Bossu in Hainault, to view the pieces of several
                masters; thence to Antwerp, where he married and entered
                into the company of painters. He excelled very particularly in representing a
                kitchen; and generally, upon all
                kinds of subjects. An altar-piece of his, viz. a crucifix,
                setting forth an executioner breaking with an iron bar the
                legs of the thieves, &amp;c. was much admired. This noble
                piece was destroyed by the rabble in the time of the insurrection, 1566, although
                the lady of Sonneveldt, in Alckmaer, offered 200 crowns for its redemption, as the
                furious
                peasants were bringing it out of the church: but they tore
                it to pieces, and trod it under foot. This he afterwards
                complained of to the populace in terms of such severity,
                that more than once they were going to murder him. Pilkington, however, speaks of a
                fine altar-piece of bis at Amsterdam, representing the death of the Virgin, as still
                existing; and of a Nativity and the Wise Men’s Offering at Delft,
                both excellent performances. He was well skilled in perspective and architecture,
                and enriched his grounds with
                elegant ornaments and animals. His figures were well disposed; their attitudes had
                abundance of variety, and their
                draperies were well chosen and well cast. He died in 1585,
                leaving three sons, who succeeded in his profession. He
                had a mean aspect, which he did not amend by any attention to the exterior; for he

        <body>
            <p>, an eminent lawyer, the grandson of Matthew Afflitto, counsellor-royal in 1409 under
                Ladislaus, was born at Naples about 1430. Being attached to the study of law from
                his youth, he made great progress, and acquired so much reputation, that he was
                promoted to the council of state by king Ferdinand I. and shared the confidence of
                that prince and of his son, afterwards Alphonsus <sc>II</sc>. He was afterwards
                appointed president of the royal chamber, and was employed in public transactions of
                the greatest importance under five successive kings of Naples. To the knowledge
                displayed in his works, he joined the strictest probity and most amiable manners.
                Camerario, lieutenant of the royal chamber, and an eminent feudal lawyer, gives him
                the character of the most learned and excellent man of his own or the preceding age;
                nor are Ferron and Fontanella more sparing of their praises. Pancirollus only
                considers him as rather laborious than acute in his writings. Notwithstanding the
                distractions of the times in which he lived, and his numerous labours, he reached
                the age of eighty, and died in 1510. He was interred in the conventual church of
                Monte-Vergine in Naples, under a monument representing St. Eustachius, from whom his
                family derived their origin. He was twice married, and from his second wife, Diana
                Carmignana, are descended the Afflittos, barons of Rocca-Gloriosa. </p>

                high estimation in which they were held. The family of Afflito has produced other

            <p>, an Italian lady of great learning, was born at Milan, March 16, 1718. Her
                inclinations from her earliest youth led her to the study of science, and at an age
                when young persons of her sex attend only to frivolous pursuits, she had made such
                astonishing progress in mathematics, that when in 1750 her father, professor in the
                university at Bologna, was unable to continue his lectures from infirm health, she
                obtained permission from the pope, Benedict <sc>XIV</sc>. to fill his chair. Before
                this, at the early age of nineteen, she had supported one hundred and ninety-one
                theses, which were published, in 1738, under the title “<q>Propositiones
                Philosophicse.</q>” She was also mistress of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, German,
                and Spanish. At length she gave up her studies, and went into the monastery of the
                Blue Nuns, at Milan, where she died Jan. 9, 1799. In 1740 she published a discourse
                tending to prove “<q>that the study of the
                    liberal arts is not incompatible with the understandings of
                    women,</q>” This she had written when scarcely nine years old. Her “<q

                late rev. John Colson, M. A. F. R. S. and Lucasian professor of mathematics in the
                university of Cambridge. This learned and ingenious man, who had translated sir
                Isaac Newton’s Fluxions&gt; with a comment, in 1736, and was well acquainted with
                what appeared on the same subject, in the course of fourteen years afterward, in the
                writings of Emerson, Maclaurin, and Simpson, found, after all, the analytical
                institutions of Agnesi to be so excellent, that he learned the Italian language, at
                an advanced age, for the sole purpose of translating that work into English, and at
                his death left the manuscript nearly prepared for the press. In this state it
                remained for some years, until Mr. Baron Ma&amp;eres, with his usual liberal and
                active spirit, resolved to defray the whole expence of printing a handsome edition,
                2 vols. 4to, 1801, which was superintended in the press by the rev. John Hellins, B.
                D. F. R. S. vicar of Potter’s-pury, in Northamptonshire. Her eloge was pronounced by
                Frisi, and translated into French by Boulard.</p>

            <p>, a sculptor and architect of Florence, was born in 1460, and was first distinguished
                for
                the beauty of his inlaid work, which he applied to articles
                of furniture, and with which he ornamented the stalls in
                the choir of the church of St. Maria-Novelle. He also
                executed the carved wooden work on the organ of the
                same church, and on the altar of de la Nunziata. Having
                been led to the study of architecture, he came to Rome to
                devote his attention to it, but did not give up the practice
                of carving, and soon had a favourable opportunity to exercise both. When Leo X.
                travelled in Italy, all the cities
                through which he passed wished to receive him with honour, and Baccio gave designs
                for many of the triumphal
                arches ordered to be erected. On his return to his country, his workshop became a
                sort of academy to which amateurs, artists, and strangers resorted. Raphael, then
                very
                young, and Michael Angelo are said to have been of these
                parties. By this means Baccio acquired great reputation,
                and was employed on many splendid buildings in Florence.
                Conjointly with Cronaca, he executed the decorations of
                the grand saloon of the palace, and the beautiful staircase
                leading to it. But his best work is to be seen in the Bartolini palace and garden.
                Here he shewed the first specimen of square windows surmounted by pediments, and
                doors ornamented by columns, a mode which although followed generally since, was
                much ridiculed by his countrymen as an innovation. In other palaces he executed some
                beautiful ornaments in wood. He preserved his vigour
                and reputation to a great age, dying in 1543, in his eightythird year. He left three
                sons, one of whom, Giuliano, inherited his skill in architecture, but designed more
                than
                he executed.</p>

            <p>, of Valerano, an eminent musician,
                was born in 1593, and was the scholar of Bernardo Nanini,
                and successor to Soriano in the pontifical chapel. Antinio
                Liberati speaks of him as one of the most scientific and
                ingenious composers of his time, in every species of music
                then cultivated; and adds, that when he was master of the
                chapel of St. Peter’s church at Rome, he astonished the
                musical world with his productions for four, six, and eight
                choirs or choruses; some of which might be sung in four
                or six parts only, without diminishing or enervating the
                harmony. Father Martini, who bears testimony to the
                truth of this eulogium, has inserted an Agnus Dei, in eight
                parts, of this composer, which is truly a curious production, three different canons
                being carried on at the same
                time, in so clear and natural a manner, both as to melody
                and harmony, that this learned father, who had been long
                exercised in such arduous enterprizes, speaks of it as one
                of the greatest efforts of genius and learning in this most difficult kind of
                composition. Agostino died in 1629, in the
                prime of life.</p>

            <p>, a singular impostor and enthusiast, the daughter of Francis Coronel, was born at
                Agreda in 1602. Her father made his house a convent of female Cordeliers, under the
                name of The Immaculate Conception, and his wife and daughters made profession. Maria
                was elected superior of the convent, and died there in 1665, after having written “<q>The
                Mystical City of God,</q>” which contains a life of the blessed Virgin, full of
                absurdity and impiety. Yet it was printed at Lisbon, at Madrid, at Perpignan, and at

                Brussels, 3 vols. 4to, and 8 vols. 8vo. The doctors of the Sorbonne condemned it;
                but their sentence was not allowed to be promulgated in Spain, where this work was

            <p>, a German physician, eminent for his knowledge of metallurgy, was born at Glaucha in
                Misnia, March 24, 1494. The discoveries which he made in the mountains of Bohemia
                after his return from Italy, whither he went to pursue his studies, gave him such a
                taste for examining every thing that related to metals, that when engaged in the
                practice of physic at Joachimstal in Misnia, he employed all the time he could
                possibly spare in the study of fossils; and at length removed to Chemintz, that he
                might wholly devote himself to this pursuit. He is said to have applied to it with
                such disinterested zeal, that he riotonly spent the pension procured for him from
                Maurice, duke of Saxony, but a considerable part of his own estate; and when duke
                Maurice and duke Augustus went to join the army of Charles V. in Bohemia, Agricola
                attended them, in order to demonstrate his attachment, although this obliged him to
                quit the care of his family and estate. He died at Chemiutz, Nov. 21, 1555. He was a
                zealous Roman Catholic, but was considered by the Lutherans as in some respects an
                apostate from the reformed, religion, and they carried their rancour against him so
                far as to refuse his body the rites of burial. It was therefore obliged to be
                removed from Chemintz to Zeits, where it was interred in the principal church. Bayle
                thinks that he must have irritated the Lutherans by some instances of excessive
                aversion to them, and Peter Albinus represents him as an intolerant bigot. His works
                are “<q>De ortu et causis Subterraneorum. De natura eorum, quae effluunt ex terra.
                    De
                    natura Fossilium. De Medicatis Fontibus. De Subterraneis Animantibus. De
                veteribus et novis Metallis. De
                    re Metallica.</q>” This last has been printed at Basil four times, in folio,
                1546, 1556, 1558, and 1561, which shews the very high esteem in which it was held.
                His work “<q date="1583">De ortu et causis Subterraneorum</q>” was printed at Basil, <date
                    event="work">1583</date>, fol. Bayle mentions a political work of his, “<q

                    bello Turcis inferendo,</q>” Basil, <date event="work">1538</date>, and a
                controversial treatise, “<q>De Traditionibus Apostolicis.</q>” His principal medical
                work, “<q date="1554">De Peste,</q>” was printed at Basil, <date event="work">1554</date>.
                He wrote also “<q>De Ponderibus et Mensuris</q>” against Budeus, Leonard Portius,
                and Alciati, which the latter endeavoured to answer, but without success. His life

                IV</sc>. of France, of which journey he wrote a very elegant account. The cardinal,
                after his return, committed the management of his house to Agucchio, which province
                he executed till the death of pope Clement <sc>VIII</sc>. and of his brother the
                cardinal Agucchio, when want of health obliged him to retire from the court. But
                after he had recovered, and had passed some time at Rome in learned retirement,
                cardinal Aldobrandini brought him again into his former employment, in which he
                continued till the cardinal’s death. He then became secretary to Gregory <sc>XV</sc>.
                which place he held until the death of that pontiff. In 1624, Urban <sc>VIII</sc>.
                sent him as nuncio to Venice, -where he became generally esteemed, although he
                maintained the rights of the see of Rome with the utmost rigour. The contagious
                distemper which ravaged Italy in 1630, obliged him to retire to Friuli, where he
                died in 1632. He was a man of very extensive learning, but appears in his private
                character to have been somewhat austere and narrow. His works are: “<q>A treatise
                upon
                    Comets and Meteors,</q>” “<q>The Life of Cardinal Sega, and
                    that of Jerom Agucchio his brother,</q>” and a letter to the canon Barthelemi
                Dolcini on the origin of the city of Bologna, “<q date="1638">L'Antica fondazione e
                dominio della citta di
                    Bologna,</q>” Bologna, <date event="work">1638</date>, 4to. He left also various
                letters and moral treatises, not published.</p>

            <p>, a very learned man of the 17th century, was born at Logrogno, a city of Spain,
                March 24, 1630, and took the degree of D. D. in the university of Salamanca in 1668,
                and read lectures in that faculty for many years. He was censor and secretary of the
                supreme council of the inquisition in Spain, chief interpreter of the scriptures in
                the university of Salamanca, and had been more than once abbot of the college of St.
                Vincent, when he was honoured with a cardinal’s hat by Innocent <sc>XI</sc>. in
                1686. He died at Rome Aug. 19, 1699. His life was very exemplary; and the dignity to
                which he was raised was so far from making any change in him, that he shewed an
                instance very uncommon, by retracting in an express piece the doctrine of
                probability, which he had before maintained, as soon as he found it was inconsistent
                with the purity of the Christian morality. His first work was entitled “<q
                    date="1668">Ludi Salmanticenses sive Theologia Florulenta,</q>” printed in <date
                    event="work">1668</date>, fol. These are dissertations which he wrote, according
                to the custom of the university of Salamanca, before he received his degree of D. D.
                there; an-d there are some things in them to which he objected in his more mature
                years. In 1671 he published three volumes in folio upon philosophy, and in 1673 “<q
                    date="1677">A commentary upon Aristotle’s ten books of Ethics.</q>” In <date
                    event="work">1677</date> he published “<q>A treatise upon Virtues and Vices, or
                Disputations on Aristotle’s Moral Philosophy.</q>” He then appfied himself to the
                study of St. Anselm’s works, upon whose principles in divinity he published “<q>The
                Theology
                    of St. Anselm,</q>” 3 vols. fol. 1690. In 1683 he published a large work against
                the declaration of the assembly of the French clergy made in 1682, concerning the
                ecclesiastical and civil power, under the title of “<q>A defence of the see
                    of St. Peter.</q>” The work for which he is chiefly celebrated is his “<q>Collection
                of the Councils of Spain</q>” with an introductory history. This was published in
                1693-4, in 4 vols. fol.; and in 1753 in 6 vols. fol. He published a Prodromus of
                this work in 1686, 8vo. It is variously spoken of; Du Pin is inclined to depreciate
                its merit. Abstracts from it may be seen in the Acta Eruditorum of Leipsic, far the
                month of February, 1688, and some farther particulars in the General Dictionary.</p>

                became a distinguished Greek scholar. lu his youth he carried arms against the king
                of Spain, was appointed a deputy to the States Genera], a member of the supreme
                council, and advocate fiscal. But he is less known by his share in the defence of
                his country, than by his learning and writings. He published: 1. “<q date="1560">Novellae

            <p>, professor of logic and metaphysics at GreifewaJd, was born in that town, Feb. 19,
                1710, and died there, March 1, 1791, after having enjoyed considerable fame, from
                his learning, zeal, benevolence, and love of truth. His father was a poor
                shoe-maker, but by extreme ceconomy his son was enabled to pursue his studies at
                Greifswald, and afterwards at the university of Jena. He became the founder of the
                society or order of the Abelites, the object of which was the promotion of candour
                and sincerity. His favourite maxim was, “<q>Give every
                    thing on which you are immediately engaged, be it ever
                    so trifling, all the attention of which you are capable.</q>” He thought he had
                discovered that want of attention is the source of lukewarmness in the cause of
                virtue, and the great promoter of vice; and imputed his attachment to the duties of
                his office and of religion, to his constant observance of the above rule. His
                principal works are: 1. “<q>Brontotheologie,</q>” or pious meditations on the
                phenomena of thunder and lightning, Greifswald, 1745, 8vo; translated into Dutch
                1747. 2. “<q date="1742">Reflexions on the Augsburgh Confession,</q>” eight parts in
                Z vols. <date event="work">1742</date> 50, 4to, which may be considered as a
                continuation of Reinbeck’s large work on the same subject. 3. Some “<q>Sermons</q>”
                and “<q date="1734">Philosophical Dissertations.</q>” In those which he published in <date
                    event="work">1734</date> and 1740, on the immortality of the soul, and the
                freedom of God, he introduced some opinions, which on more mature consideration he
                thought inconsistent with the truth, and published a confutation of them.</p>

            <p>, <csc>Ethelred</csc>, <csc>Ælred</csc>, or <csc>Ealred</csc>, abbot of Revesby in
                Lincolnshire in the reigns of king Stephen and king Henry <sc>II</sc>. was born of
                nobie parents, in 1109, and educated in Scotland, together with Henry, son of David,
                king of Scots. Upon his return into England, he took the habit in the Cistertian
                monastery of Revesby, where his extraordinary piety and learning soon raised him to
                the dignity of abbot. Leland says he outshone his brethren as the sun eclipses the
                brightness of the inferior luminaries: and endeared himself no less to the great men
                of the kingdom than to the monks of his own house. His great love of retirement, and
                a life of contemplation and study, induced him to decline all offers of
                ecclesiastical preferment, and even to refuse a bishopric. He was particularly
                attached to St. Austin’s works, especially his “<q>Confessions;</q>” and was a
                strict imitator of St. Bernard in his writings, words, and actions. He left behind
                him several monuments of his learning; in the composition of which he was assisted
                by Walter Daniel, a monk of the same convent. This abbot died January 12, 1166, aged
                fifty-seven years, and was buried in the monastery of Revesby, under a tomb adorned
                with gold and silver; and, we are told, he was canonized on account of some miracles
                said to have been wrought by him after his death. </p>
            <p>Of his works, the following have been printed in the “<q date="1652">Collection of

            <p>, provost of Queen’s college, Oxford, was born in Westmoreland in 1559, educated in
                grammatical learning under the care of Bernard Gilpin, usually called the Northern
                Apostle, and by him sent to St. Edmund’s hall, Oxford, in 1579. He was then 19 years
                of age, and was maintained at the university by Gilpin, who afterwards left him a
                handsome legacy by his last will. Mr. Airay soon removed from St. Edmund’s hall to
                Queen’s college, and in 1583, took his bachelor’s degree, was made tabarder, and in
                1586 he commenced master of arts and was chosen fellow. About this time he went into
                orders, and became a constant preacher in the university, particularly in the church
                of St. Peter in the east. In 1594, he took the degree of B. D. and March 9, 1598-9,
                was elected provost of his college; and in 1606 he was appointed vice-chancellor. He
                wrote the following pieces: 1. “<q date="1618">Lectures upon the
                    whole Epistle of St. Paul to the Philippians,</q>” London, <date event="work">
                1618</date>, 4to. 2. “<q date="1621">The just and necessary Apology touching his
                    Suit in Law, for the Rector of Charlton on Otmore, in Oxfordshire,</q>” London, <date
                    event="work">1621</date>, 8vo. 3. “<q>A Treatise against
                    bowing at the Name of Jesus.</q>” The lectures were preached in the church of
                St. Peter in the east, and were published by Christopher Potter, fellow, and
                afterwards provost of Queen’s college, with an epistle of his own composition
                prefixed to them. Airay ranks among the zealous Puritans, who were mostly
                Calvinists, and was a great supporter of his party in the university, where he was
                considered as a man of sincere piety, integrity, and learning. In 1602 when Dr.
                Howson, then vice-chancellor, wished to repress the practice of some Puritan divines
                of Oxford who preached against the ceremonies and discipline of the church, Dr.
                Airay and one or two otherlj were ordered to make submission by the queen’s
                commissioners who had investigated the matter; and this the others did, but Dr.
                Airay, according to Ant. Wood, appears to have been excused. In 1604, when king
                James, in commemoration of his escape from the Gowrie conspiracy, not only appointed
                an anniversary, but that there should always be a sermon and service on Tuesdays
                throughout the year, Dr. Airay introduced this last custom into Oxford, first at All
                Saints church, and then at St. Mary’s, with a rule that the sermons should be
                preached by the divines of the colleges in their respective turns. In 1606, when
                vice-chancellor, he was one of the first to call Mr. Laud, afterwards the celebrated
                archbishop, to task for preaching sentiments which were supposed to favour popery.
                He died in Queen’s college, Oct. 10, 1616, aged fiftyseven, and was buried in the
                chapel. He bequeathed to the college some lands lying in Garsington, near Oxford.</p>

            <p>, a gentleman of Frizeland, was born at Doccum in 1600, of a considerable family. His
                father, Menard Aitzema, was burgomaster and secretary to the admiralty, and his
                uncle Foppius was resident for the states-general at Hamburgh, and often employed in
                negociations of the first importance. Leo had scarcely reached his sixteenth year,
                before he published his Poemuta Juvenilia, but was soon engaged in more serious
                studies, his uncle having procured him to be appointed counsellor of the Hanse
                towns, and their resident at the Hague. He is likewise said to have been twice in
                England on public affairs. The work for which he is best known is a compilation on
                the history of the United Provinces, written in Dutch, under the title of “<q>Zaken
                van Staat en Oorlog.</q>” Of this there have been two editions, the first in 16
                vols. 4to, 1657 1671, including the period between 1621 and 1668. The second edition
                is in 7 vols. fol. 1669 1671, with an account of the peace of Munster, and a
                treatise entitled the “<q date="1650">Lion restored,</q>” or an account of Dutch
                affairs in <date event="work">1650</date> and 1651, which had been separately
                published in 1652, 4to. The first edition is most esteemed by collectors of history,
                as in the second there were several omissions, although not of great importance; on
                the other hand this second is more correct, and the articles better arranged. It
                consists of an immense collection of original acts, instructions, memorials,
                letters, correspondence of crowned heads, &amp;c. taken from the most authentic and
                often most secret sources. He is said to have employed much address in procuring the
                documents which he wanted. His connection with men in office gave him considerable
                advantages, but he often used means not quite so ingenuous and delicate. The Dutch
                reproach him with having divulged their secret correspondence with foreign courts,
                and particularly with England, and he is also accused of irreligious principles.
                Wicquefort, in his Ambassador, speaks slightingly of the original part of this great
                work, in which Bayle says he cannot agree with him. Voluminous, however, as it is,
                and in many parts uninteresting, it throws great light on the history of the times,
                and from it the “<q>Histoire des Provinces Unies,</q>” 8 vols. 4to, Paris, 1757
                1771, is principally taken. A continuation of it, extending to the year 1697, was
                published by Lambert Bos, 4 vols. fol. Aitzema died in 1669 at the Hague, his usual
                residence.</p>

                of education in the college of Itzehoe, which he left at the age of sixteen, he
                passed rive years in the college of Luneburgh, and went from that to Wittemherg,
                where he distinguished himself by the able defence of his theses. In 1595, he was
                called home, and made joint rector of the college of Krempen, and afterwards chosen
                pastor of the church of that place. He died May 8, 1644. aged 72 years and six

            <p>, son of the preceding, was born at Krempen in 1600, and first studied there and at
                Harhburgh. At the age of nineteen, he went to the academy of Leipsic, where he
                entered on a course of theology and political science. In 1624, he had acquired much
                reputation both as a philosopher and a poet. When he returned to Krempen, he was
                made dean of the college, and held that station during five years. After this, the
                king of Denmark appointed hin&gt; inspector of the schools at Brunswick, and
                assessor of the council of Meldorf, In 1643, by order of the emperor, he was created
                master of arts, and not being able, on account of the war, to go into Saxony, he was
                made a licentiate in divinity by diploma, or bull, which was sent to him. He died

            <p>, a celebrated physician of Sicily, was born in 1590 at Ragalbuto, in the valley of
                Demona, and when young acquired great reputation for his proficiency in classical
                learning, and in the study of philosophy. He then made choice of the profession of
                medicine, and received his doctor’s degree at Messina in 1610. In 1616 he settled at
                Palermo, where he practised with uncommon success, his advice being eagerly sought
                at home and abroad, by persons of all ranks who corresponded with him in cases where
                his visits could not be procured. His fame rose highest, however, in 1624, when he
                practised with so much skill, humanity, and success, during the rage of the plague
                in Palermo, and other parts of Sicily. While in this prosperous career, he was in
                vain solicited to accept a professor’s chair in the university of Bologna, and the
                office of first physician to the king of Naples. Nothing could seduce him from his
                connexions in Palermo, where he had the principal hand in founding the medical
                academy. He is celebrated also for his piety and munificence towards religious
                institutions. He died August 29, 1662. His principal works are in Latin. 1. “<q
                    date="1632">Consultatio pro ulceris Syriaci nunc vagantis curatione,</q>”
                Palermo, <date event="work">1632</date>, 4lo. 2. “<q date="1637">De succedaneis

                cardinal by Innocent <sc>XIII</sc>. He died Dec. 2, 1779, aged 87, He showed great
                dignity in his embassy to the emperor; and displayed much learning while he held the
                place of librarian of the Vatican. He had great taste and knowledge of antiquities,
                and became a munificent patron of learning and learned men. His house, known by the
                name of the Villa Albani, was decorated with valuable statues and other treasures of
                the fine arts. He also found leisure from his political engagements to write some
                historical and literary works, which are held in much esteem. In 1762, his
                collection of drawings, consisting of three hundred volumes, one third of which are
                original drawings of the first masters, the others, collections of the most capital
                engravings, were sold to his present majesty of Great Britain, for 14,000 crowns.</p>

            <p>, of the same family with the preceding, born in 1504, at Bergamo, was the son of
                count Francis Albani, and intended by his father for the army, but preferred the
                study of the civil and canon law, in which, as well as in polite literature, he
                attained great eminence. At first, however, he bore arms in the Venetian army, and
                afterwards went into the church. Pope Pius V. was no sooner raised to that dignity,
                than he made Albani a cardinal, in 1570. It is even said that after the death of
                Gregory <sc>XIII</sc>. the conclave would have elected him pope, but he was then a
                widower and had cliildren, a circumstance which interfered with their intentions. He

            <p>, grandson of the constable de Luynes, was the ninth child of Louis-Charles, duke de
                Luynes, grand almoner of France. He was born in 1672, and had in his youth the title
                of the chevalier d‘Albert. In 1688, he served as a volunteer at the siege of
                Philipshurgh; in 1690 he was twice wounded in the battle of Fleurus; and in 1693,
                commanded the Dauphin regiment of dragoons at Steinkirk, where he was again wounded.
                In 1703, he accompanied marshal Villars into Bavaria, where the elector promoted him
                to the rank of lieutenant-general. He was then known by the title of count d’
                Albert, and was successively chamberlain, master of the horse, minister, and colonel
                of the Bavarian guards. The elector having arrived at the throne in 1742, by the
                royal title of Charles <sc>VII</sc>. appointed count d' Albert field marshal, and
                sent him to France as ambassador extraordinary. The same year the emperor created
                him a prince of the holy Roman empire, by the title of prince of Grimberghen, taken
                from the rich domains he acquired by marrying a princess of Berghes. He died Nov.

            <p>, a painter of some distinction, but whose reputation is chiefly established by his
                engravings, was born in 1552 atBorgo S. Sepolcbro, from which he derived one of his
                names. From his father, Michele Alberti, he learned the first rudiments of
                historical painting, in which art he made very considerable progress. His greatest
                works are in fresco at Rome; and he also painted in oil, and combined some thought
                with much practice. From whose instructions he became an engraver is uncertain, but
                his best style of execution seems evidently to have been founded on the prints of C.
                Cort and Agostino Caracci, though in his friezes and other slighter plates he owed
                much to the works of Francesco Villemena. The engravings of Alberti are never very
                highly finished, or powerful in effect. The lights are scattered and left untinted,
                as well upon the distances, as upon the principal figures of the fore-ground, which
                destroys the harmony, and, prevents the proper gradation of the objects. The drawing
                of the naked parts of the figure, in the works of this artist, is rarely incorrect:
                the extremities are well marked, and the characters of the heads generally very
                expressive: but his draperies are apt to be rather stitf and hard. His prints may be
                considered as very extraordinary efforts of a great genius, whilst the art was as
                yet at some considerable distance from perfection. The number of plates, great and
                small, engraved by this artist, amounts to nearly one hundred and eighty, of which
                seventy-five are from his own compositions, the rest from Michael Angelo Buonaroti,
                Raphael, Polidoro, Andrea del Sarto, &amp;c. The “<q date="1615">Miracle
                    of St. Philip Benizzo</q>” is one of the most excellent. Alberti died in <date

                languages, gave an abridgment of the Koran, with critical
                notes, 1543, 4to; a work which procured him the title of
                chancellor of Austria, and chevalier of St. James. He
                published in 4to, in 1556, a New Testament in Syriac,
                from the manuscript used by the Jacobites, at the expence
                of the emperor Ferdinand I. It contains neither the second epistle of Peter, nor the
                second and third of John,
                nor that of Jude, nor the Apocalypse. Only 1000 copies
                were printed, of which five hundred remained in Germany,
                and the rest were sent to the Levant. It is impossible for
                any thing to be more elegant, or better proportioned, says
                pere Simon, than the characters of this edition. Some
                copies have the date of T562. He also composed a Syriac
                grammar, to which is prefixed a very curious preface. He

            <p>, avery eminent German physician, and one of the ablest scholars, and supporters of
                the opinions of Stahl, was born at Nuremberg, Nov. 13, 1682. He became professor of
                medicine at Hall, and an author of great celebrity. The object of the principal part
                of his works is to oppose the system of the mechanicians, and to establish that of
                Stahl; and although he may not be completely successful in this, it is generally
                agreed that his works contributed to throw great light on the sound practice of
                physic. Haller has given a copious list of his works, as well as of the disputations
                he maintained. Those which have contributed most to his fame, are, 1. “<q>Introductio
                in universam medicinam,</q>” 3 vols. 4to, Hall, 1718, 1719, 1721. In this he
                maintains the power of nature in the cure of diseases, and the danger of interfering
                with her operations. 2. “<q date="1725">Systema Jurisprudentiae Medicse,</q>” <date
                    event="work">1725</date> 47, 6 vols. 4to, a work which embraces every possible
                case in which the opinion of the physician may be necessary in the decisions of law.
                3. “<q date="1726">Specimen medicoe Theologicae,</q>” Hall, <date event="work">1726</date>,
                8vo. 4. “<q>Tentamen lexici medici realis,</q>” 2 vols. 4to, 1727—1731, ibid. 5. “<q

                most of these works the subjects are treated in a philosophical as well as practical

                others who founded the new school of anatomy, and himself made several important
                discoveries in the structure of the ear, the eye, &amp;c. His “<q date="1583">Historia

            <p>, professor of divinity at Leipsic, was born in 1635, at Lehna in Silesia, and died
                at Leipsic in 1697. He wrote a great many controversial treatises against
                Puffendorf, Thomasius, the Cartesians, Cocceians, and the adversaries of the
                Augsburgh communion, especially Bossuet and count Leopold de Collonitsch, bishop of
                Wienerisch-Nenstadt. Alberti attacked also the orthodoxy of the pious Spener, the
                Fenelon of the Lutheran church, but who has been censured for his leaning too ranch
                to the pietists and mystics. Among his writings, which have been most favourably
                received and frequently reprinted, we may notice his “<q>Compendium Juris naturae,
                    11
                    against Puffendorff, and his</q>” Interesse prsecipuarum religionum Christian.“<q>He

                1662, 4to. Adelung, who has given a list of his works, says that his German poems
                are not bad, if we consider the imperfections of that language, and the false taste
                which prevailed in his time.</p>

                profession for six years. He afterwards taught philosophy, and became a popular
                preacher, and his zeal and talents pointed him out as the proper person to succeed
                to the vacant bishopric of Torcello, which, however, was given to another. The
                republic of Venice employed him in many affairs of state, and even sent him as
                ambassa dor to Turkey. He died in the prime of life in 1475, when his reputation was
                such, that a medal was struck in honour of his memory. He left, according to
                Sansovino, several works in Latin, on the knowledge of God, the history of the
                Servites, and other theological subjects, and an explanation of some passages in

                of the Jesuits at the age of sixteen. After having taught the languages for seven
                years, he studied divinity, which he afterwards taught, with philosophy, for twelve
                years, and was successively rector of the colleges of Avignon, Aries, Grenoble, and
                Lyons. He died at Aries, Octobers, 1659. He wrote, 1. “<q date="1644">Eloges

                translation of it in 1649, in which he professed to have undertaken this labour as
                an answer to those who declaimed against performing and attending mass in parishes;
                and when Albi’s Anti-Theophile appeared, answered him in a work entitled “<q>Reponse

            <p>, an eminent physician, whose proper name was <csc>Weiss</csc>, was born at Dessau,
                in the province of Anhalt, in 1653, and was the son of a burgomaster of that town.
                He studied first at Bremen, and afterwards at Leyden. In 1676, after taking his
                doctor’s degree in medicine, he travelled in Flanders, France, and Lorraine, and
                returned, in 1681, to the possession of a professor’s chair at Francfort on the
                Oder. In his mode of teaching he discovered those talents and that penetration, of
                which he exhibited some proofs while a student, and soon rose to wealth and
                distinction. He was appointed physician to the successive electors of Brandenburgh,
                who bestowed many honours upon him, and among other marks of their favour, gave him
                a prebend of Magdeburgh, exempting him, at the same time, from the duties of the
                place; but this he resigned, as the possession of so rich a preferment, under such
                circumstances, might give offence to his brethren. For a long time the obligations
                which these princes conferred prevented Albinus from accepting the many offers made
                to him by the universities of Europe; but at length, in 1702, he went to Leyden,
                where he was professor until his death in 1721. Carrere, in his “<q>Bibl. de
                Medicine,</q>” gives a list of twenty-two medical works by Albinus, among which are,
                1. “<q>De corpusculis in sanguine contends.</q>” 2. “<q>De Tarantula mira.</q>” 3. “<q>De

            <p>, a Spanish poet of the seventeenth century, who was born at Lisbon in 1599, and
                carried on the business of a merchant. Devoting his leisure hours to literature, he
                wrote a work entitled “<q>Viridarium anagrammaticum,</q>” and five “<q>Novels,</q>”
                which procured him, it is said, much reputation, not from their merit, but from
                their originality. In each of these novels, the author has contrived to get rid of
                one or other of the vowels: a is not to be found in the first, nor e in the second,
                &amp;c. But this idle whim was not original, the same having been practised by
                Tryphiodorus, whom Addison so pleasantly ridicules as one of the lipogrammatists, or
                letterdroppers of antiquity. Moreri gives us the title of another work by this
                author, printed at Lisbon, 1664. “<q>Psalteriurn

            <p>, <csc>Alçazar</csc>, or <csc>Alcasar</csc>, (Louis D'), a Spanish Jesuit, was born
                at Seville in 1554, and entered among the Jesuits in 1569, against the will of his
                family, who were in possession of a large estate. After he had been a teacher of
                philosophy, he taught divinity at Cordova and at Seville, for abov e twenty years. M
                uch of his life was spent in endeavouring to explain the book of the Revelations,
                and his first volume on the subject, “<q>Vestigatio arcani sensus in Apocalypsi,</q>”
                is said to have been the result of twenty years’ study and investigation. This work
                was printed at Antwerp, fol. 1604 and 1619, and at Lyons, 1616, fol.; and is
                accounted one of the best commentaries which had been produced by any writer of the
                Romish church. It is said that Grotius was considerably indebted to it; but neither
                Grotius, nor any other writer has followed him in supposing that the prophecies of
                the Apocalypse have been accomplished to the twentieth chapter. Pursuing this
                investigation, however, his next work was a commentary on such parts of the Old
                Testament as have any connexion with the Apocalypse; this was published in 1631,
                Lyons, fol. under the title, “<q>In eas veteris
                    Testament! partes, quas respicit Apocalypsis, nempe Cantica Canticorum, Psahnos
                complures, multa Danielis aliorumque librorum capita, libri V.</q>” There is a
                supplement to the first, on weights and measures, and to the second, on bad
                physicians. He died at Seville, June 16, 1613.</p>

            <p>, a celebrated artist, was born at Zoust in Westphalia, in 1502; but we have no
                account of his family, nor are we quite certain of his Christian name, some calling
                him Henry, and some Albert. It is said, that he went to Nuremberg, and studied under
                Albert Durer, as he copied his style. As a painter, he attained considerable fame:
                the principal part of his works are in the churches and convents of Germany. Des
                Piles mentions a “<q>Nativity</q>” by him, which he accounts worthy of the
                admiration of the curious. He is, however, chiefly known by his engravings; and as,
                like many of the ancient engravers, particularly of Germany, he applied himself
                chiefly to the engraving of small plates, he has been classed by French authors
                among those they call little masters, and in this class he claims the first rank.
                The mechanical part of his engraving is extremely neat, and executed entirely with
                the graver. The light parts upon his flesh he has often rendered very soft and
                clear, by the addition of small long dots, which he has judiciously interspersed.
                His drawing of the naked figure, which he seems very fond of introducing, is much
                correcter than is usually found among the old German masters; and much less of that
                stiff taste, so common to them, appears in his best works. But Florent le Comte’s
                observation is certainly very just, that his men figures are far more correct than
                his women. His heads are very expressive in general, and his other extremities well
                marked, but sometimes rather heavy. But as his prints are very numerous, amounting,
                according to abbe de Marolles, to no less than 350, they cannot be supposed to be
                all equal; it is, therefore, necessary to see many of his prints, before any
                adequate judgment can be formed. The first collection of them was formed by the
                burgomaster Six, but to this many additions were made by Mariette, to the amount of
                390 pieces, comprising many duplicates with differences. This collection was sold in
                France, in 1805, for 660 francs. He died at Soest, in 1558, in very poor
                circumstances,</p>

                biographers. They studied the belles lettres, antiquities, and civil law, with equal
                ardour and equal reputation. They both became ecclesiastics, and even in their
                persons there was a very close resemblance. Joseph obtained a prebend of Cordova,
                which he resigned in favour of Bernard, that he might enter among the Jesuits. He
                afterwards became rector of the college of Granada. While among the Jesuits, he
                published a work on the “<q date="1605">Exemption of the regular Orders,</q>”
                Seville, <date event="work">1605</date>, 4to; and another entitled “<q date="1615">De
                religiosa disciplina tuenda,</q>” ibid. 4to, <date event="work">1615</date>.
                Bernard, his brother, was appointed grand vicar by the archbishop of Seville, don
                Pedro de Castro, but obtained permission to reside at Cordova. He was one of the
                most learned and high esteemed of the Spanish literati of his time, and eminent for
                his knowledge of the Greek, Hebrew, and Oriental languages and antiquities. He has
                left two works, in Spanish: 1. “<q date="1606">Origen de la lengua Castellana,</q>”
                Rome, <date event="work">1606</date>, 4to; 1682, fol.; to which he acknowledges his
                brother Joseph contributed liberally. 2. “<q date="1614">Varias antiguedades de
                Espana Africa y otras provincias,</q>” Antwerp, <date event="work">1614</date>, 4to.
                He also wrote a letter to pope Urban <sc>VIII</sc>. on the relics of certain
                martyrs, Cordova, 1630, fol., and a collection of letters on the sacrament. He had
                composed a “<q>Boe'tia illustrata,</q>” the loss of which is regretted by the
                Spanish antiquaries. Joseph was born in 1560, and died in 1616; but the dates of the

                he was installed canon of Windsor, and the same year he was appointed register of
                the most noble order of the garter. July 18, 1537, he was consecrated bishop of
                Carlisle. He wrote several pieces, particularly 1. “<q>Epistola ad Gulielmum
                Hormannum.</q>” 2. “<q>Epigrammata varia.</q>” 3. “<q>Several Resolutions concerning
                the
                    Sacraments.</q>” 4. “<q>Answers to certain Queries concerning the Abuses of the
                Mass.</q>” He wrote also resolutions of seme questions relating to bishops and
                priests, and other matters tending to the reformation of the church begun by king
                Henry <sc>VIII</sc>. Leland was his familiar acquaintance, and gives him a 'high
                character for parts and learning. The prelate died March 25, 1555, at Horncastle, in
                Lincolnshire, which was a house belonging to the bishops of Carlisle. </p>
            <p>When he was senior proctor, he was employed by the university to write three letters
                to the king, and the following curious entry in the proctor’s book for 1527, proves
                this fac-L “<q>Magistro Aldryg pro tribus literis
                    missis ad Dominum regem, IDs.</q>” He was a correspondent of Erasmus, who termed
                him, when young, “<q>blandae
                    eloquentiae juvenis,</q>” and appears to have associated with him during his
                residence at Cambridge. Fuller is of opinion that he belongs to the light rather
                than the dark side of the reformation; but Strype seems to doubt whether he was well
                affected to this great change. He was certainly, however, not a persecutor; and the
                mildness or timidity of his disposition may account for his retaining his offices
                during reigns of opposite principles. It yet remains to be noticed that in 1523, he
                was one of the Cambridge university-preachers, who were sent out by the university
                to preach in different parts of the nation, as the judges now go their circuits;
                there being at. that time very few men of ability in any county.</p>

                Paris. Pelisson and father Bouhours were his friends here, but he offended the
                latter by obtaining from the abbe de la Chambre, a manuscript of Vaugelas, which he
                published under the title of “<q date="1690">Nouvelles remarques de M. de Vuugelas

                this work, and Alemand promised to answer him, which we do not find that he
                performed. His other publications were, 1. “<q date="1688">Nouvelles Observations,

            <p>, an antiquary of great learning, was born of Greek parents, Jan. 12, 1583, and
                educated in the Greek college founded by pope Gregory <sc>XIII</sc>. where he made a
                vast progress in learning, and was no less esteemed for the integrity of his morals.
                He afterwards entered into holy orders. He probably at first intended to settle in
                Greece, and applied to a.' Greek bishop, who ordained him a sub-deacon; but he
                afterwards changed his mind, and received the other sacred orders from the hands of
                the bishops of the Romish church. Erythneus, in his “<q>Pinacotheca,</q>” although a
                zealous Roman Catholic, insinuates, that in this change Alemanni was influenced by
                the prospect of interest. His fortune, however, being still inconsiderable, he
                employed himself in teaching the Greek language to several persons of distinguished
                rank, and gained the friendship of Scipio Cobellutius, who was at that time
                secretary of the briefs to pope Paul V. This paved the way for his obtaining the
                post of secretary to cardinal Borghese, which, however, he did not fill to the
                entire satisfaction of his employer, from his being more intimately conversant in
                Greek than Latin, and mixing Greek words in his letters. He was afterwards made
                keeper of the Vatican library, for which he was considered as amply qualified. He
                died July 24, 1626. His death is said to have been occasioned by too close an
                attendance on the erection of the great altar of the church of St. Peter at Rome. It
                was necessary for him to watch that no person should carry away any part of the
                earth dug up, which had been sprinkled with the blood of the martyrs, and in his
                care he contracted some distemper, arising from the vapours, which soon ended his
                days. He published “<q date="1663">Procopii Historic Arcana, Gr. et Lat. Nic.

                at Cologn, and in 1676 entered the order of St. Ignatius. He was professor of
                philosophy, theology, and the belles lettres, at Cologn, until the year 1691. He was
                afterwards, in 1701, invited to the university of Treves, where he gave his course
                of lectures on theology, and was appointed, in 1703, regent of the gymnastic school,
                and about the same time he was employed in the organization and direction of the
                gymnastic academies of Munster, Aachen, Treves, and Juliers. He died in 1727, at

            <p>, the most celebrated architect of his
                time, was born at Perusia in 1500, and died in 1572. His
                reputation was spread over almost all Europe. He furnished France, Spain, and
                Germany, with plans, not only
                for palaces and churches, but also for public fountains and
                baths, in which he displayed the fertility of his genius.
                The plan that brought him the most honour was that of
                the monastery and the church of the Escurial, which was
                adopted in preference to all that had been presented by
                the most able architects of Europe. Several cities and
                towns of Italy are also decorated by edifices of his construction; but there is not
                one where so many of them are seeu
                as at Genoa; the cupola of the cathedral and the Grimaldi
                and Pallavicini palaces are by him; and it is doubtless on
                account of the number of these magnificent monuments,
                that that city has merited the name of Genoa the superb.
                It is said, that Alessi was likewise verv learned, and had
                a capacity for managing concerns of the utmost importance.
                Some of his works were engraven at Antwerp in 1663,

            <p>, a young writer of very promising
                talents, was born in Ireland in 1736, whither his father, a
                dissenting teacher at Stratford upon Avon, had removed;
                and from whence, on his death, the widow and family
                returned to England. After having gone through a grammatical education, John was
                sent to the dissenting academy
                at Daventry, where he prosecuted his studies with commendable diligence, and was
                afterwards put under the tuition of Dr. Benson, who had sometimes young students
                under his care, after they had finished their university or
                academical education, for the purpose of instructing them
                in a more critical acquaintance with the sacred writings.
                He afterwards entered into the ministry, which he exercised in and near Birmingham,
                but principally at a small
                village called Longdon, about twelve miles from that place.
                On Saturday, Dec. 28, 1765, he returned to rest, in perfect health, between eleven
                and twelve o'clock, intending
                to officiate at Longdon next day but at six in the morning he was found dead in his
                bed; an event which was sincerely deplored by his friends, both as a private and a
                public loss.
            </p>
            <p>After his death, the rev. John Palmer of London published a work of his, entitled “<q>A
                Paraphrase upon the
                    15th chapter of the first epistle to the Corinthians; with
                    critical notes and observations, and a Preliminary Dissertation, a Commentary,
                with critical Remarks, upon the
                    6th, 7th, and part of the 8th chapters to the Romans.</q>” To which is added, “<q
                    date="1766">A Sermon on Ecclesiastes ix. 10.

                    event="work">1766</date>, 4to. Mr. Palmer has bestowed high praise on the
                critical sagacity and learning displayed in this work. It is some deduction from its
                merit,' however, that, in the preliminary dissertation, he favours the opinion of
                there being no state of consciousness between death and the resurrection. Of his
                talents, in another respect, a much more favourable opinion may be formed from the
                papers he wrote in “<q>The Library,</q>” a monthly publication, conducted, if we
                mistake not, principally by Dr. Kippis. In this, Mr. Alexander wrote an ironical “<q>Defence
                of persecution, essays
                    on Dullness, Common Sense, Misanthropy, the Study df
                    Man, Controversy, the Misconduct of Parents, Modern
                    Authorship, the present state of Wit in Great Britain, the
                    Index of the Mind, and the Fate of periodical productions.</q>” In some of these
                he displays genuine humour, not inferior indeed to that of most of our celebrated
                Essayists. He appears to have been a man of great worth, learning, and modesty. </p>
            <p>He had a brother, Dr. <csc>Benjamin</csc> 
                <csc>Alexander</csc>, a phyjwcian in London,

                Jews, that they study it
                more than the original, and call it the little Talmud. It

                and honours upon him, and gave him, the superintendance of a college which he had
                founded at Bagdad. Algazeli, after retaining this office four years, embraced a
                solitary life, travelled into Syria and Palestine, and employed himself in the
                composition of his works, until his death in 1111. Among his papers was a treatise
                censuring with great freedom some articles of the Mahometan faith; this was of
                course immediately committed to the flames. He left, however, many other works, some
                of which have been translated either into Latin or Hebrew. His treatise on “<q

                    Vernerey.</q>” This, as well as Alix’s other works, is very scarce. Le Long, in
                his historical library of France, attributes to him the “<q>History of the abb ay of
                St. Paul,</q>” but it is doubted whether his talents lay in that direction. He had,
                however, studied mathematics, and left some manuscripts on that subject, which have
                been lost. He died July 6, 1676.</p>

            <p>, a learned Dutch antiquary, was born in 1654, and amidst the duties of his office as
                first commissioner of convoys and licences, found leisure to publish many curious
                works. His first, in 1699, was a “<q>Dissertation on Tournaments,</q>” in which he
                treats of the ceremonies used at the court of Holland ti the days of chivalry. The
                third edition, published in 1740, by Peter van der Schelling, his son-in-law, had
                the addition of a dissertation on the origin, progress, and decline, of tournaments
                and single combats. Alkemade was afterwards editor of the metrical chronicle of
                Melis Sitoke, Leyden, 1699, fol. containing a history of Holland to 1337, with
                engraved portraits of all the counts of Holland. In 1700, he published “<q>Muntspiegel
                der Graven van Holland,</q>” &amp;c. Delft, fol. a chronological series of coins
                struck under the reigns of the counts from Floris <sc>III</sc>. to Philip <sc>II</sc>.
                His next work was a treatise on modes of Burial, Delft, 1713, 8vo. This, he modestly
                says, is only an attempt which may perhaps excite others to investigate the subject
                more fully. But his princi[&gt;al work, and that which is most esteemed by his
                countrymen, was published in 1732, under the title of “<q>Nedenandsche
                Displechtigheden,</q>” 3 vols. 8va, a work not only extremely curious for its
                illustration of the ancient manners of the Dutch, but for the number of its
                beautiful engravings. His son-in-law assisted in completing and preparing this work
                for the press. After publishing some other works of less note, he concluded his
                literary labours by a description of the town of Brill, and died in 1737, at the
                advanced age of eighty-three.</p>

            <p>, or rather <csc>Allen</csc> (<csc>Thomas</csc>), a pious English divine, was born
                about 1682, and educated at Wadham college, Oxford, where he probably took only his
                bachelor’s degree, as we do not find him in the list of upper graduates. In 1714 he
                was presented to the rectory of Kettering, in Northamptonshire, on which he resided
                the whole of his life, and was exemplary in all the duties of the pastoral office,
                nor less indefatigable as a writer, although his success in this last character bore
                little proportion to the magnitude of his labours. Of his printed works we know
                only, 1. “<q date="1716">The Practice of an Holy Life; or the
                    Christian’s Daily Exercise, in Meditations, Prayer, &amp;c.</q>” London, <date

                    Eternal Glory,</q>” both popular works, and afterwards translated into the
                Russian language. 3. “<q date="1744">A Sermon before
                    the Criminals in Newgate,</q>” <date event="work">1744</date>. 4. “<q
                    date="1753">The New Birth,
                    or Christian Regeneration, in Miltonic or blank verse,</q>” <date event="work">
                1753</date>, 8vo. Besides these, he wrote “<q>Pandects of Christianity</q>” “<q>The
                harmony and agreement between Moses
                    and Christ</q>” “<q>The Primitive and Apostolic Fathers, with
                    their genuine Writings</q>” “<q>God the best interpreter of his
                    law</q>” “<q>The Divine Worship and Service of the Church
                    of England,</q>” with some others, for which he issued proposals, but was
                obliged to desist from want of encouragement. Lists of these <csc>Mss</csc>. he sent
                to various clergymen, requesting they would bear the expence, &amp;c.; and
                accompanied them with letters in an eccentric style, and with no small portion of
                conceit. Mr. Allen died May 31, 1755, suddenly, as he was reading prayers in his
                church.</p>

            <p>, an English lawyer and antiquary,
                was born at Great Hadham in Hertfordshire, about the end
                of the seventeenth century, and was educated at Eton;
                whence he went to King’s college, Cambridge, and took
                his bachelor’s degree in 1707, and his master’s in 1711.
                He afterwards studied law, was called to the bar, and by
                the influence of Arthur Onslow, speaker of the house of
                commons, became a master in chancery. His reputation
                as a lawyer was inconsiderable, but he was esteemed a good
                classical scholar, and a man of wit and convivial habits.
                He became afterwards an alderman of the corporation of
                Guildford, and an useful magistrate in that neighbourhood.
                He died April 11, 1754, and was buried in the Temple
                church. He collected a biographical account of the members of Eton college, which by
                his will, dated 1753, he ordered to be placed in the libraries of the two colleges,
                and
                a third copy to be given to his patron, Mr. Onslow. He
                also compiled, at his leisure hours, or rather made collections for, an English
                dictionary of obsolete words, of words
                which have changed their meaning, as villain, knave, and of
                proverbial or cant words, as helter-skelter, which he derived
                from hiiariter cderiter. It is not known what became of
                this manuscript. He bequeathed his fortune, and probably
                his books, to a brother who was a Turkey merchant.</p>

            <p>, a learned divine, was born in the year 1573, educated in the king’s school at
                Worcester, and from thence removed to Brazen-nose college, Oxford, 1589. He was
                elected a probationer fellow of Merton college in 1593. He afterwards went into
                orders; but, instead of preaching, he applied himself to the more abstruse and
                critical parts of learning. This recommended him to the esteem of sir Henry Savile,
                by whose interest he obtained a fellowship of Eton college in 1604, and whom he
                assisted in his elaborate edition of St. Chrysostom. While at Eton, he assisted the
                studies of Dr. Hammond, then a school-boy, particularly in the Greek language. He
                wrote “<q>Observationes in libellum Chrysostomi in Esaiam.</q>” He died Oct. 10,
                1638, and was buried in Eton college chapel. He was a benefactor in books to the

            <p>, a celebrated Piedmontese physician, and professor of -Botany, in the university of
                Turin, was born in 1725, and died in 1804. On account of his high reputation for
                learning, he was elected a member of many scientific societies, such as the
                institute of Bologna, and the royal societies of London, Montpellier, Gottingen,
                Madrid, &amp;c. Of his numerous medical and botanical publications, the following
                are the principal: 1, “<q date="1755">Pedemontii
                    stirpium rariorum specimen primum,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1755</date>,
                4to, containing the description and figures of thirty plants, either new or little
                known, which grow on the mountains of Piedmont. 2. “<q date="1757">OryctographiiE
                Pedemontan;e
                    specimen,</q>” Paris, <date event="work">1757</date>, 8vo; an account of the
                fossils in Piedmont. 3. “<q date="1758">Tractatio de miliarium origine, progressu,
                natura, et curatione,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1758</date>, 8vo; a medical
                treatise much esteemed. 4. “<q>Stirpium præcipuarum
                    littoris et agri Nicaeensis enumeratio methodica, cum
                    elencho aliquot animalium ejusdem maris,</q>” Paris, 1757, 8vo. This work is
                often quoted by naturalists under the abridged title of “<q>Enumeratio stirpium
                Nicaeensis.</q>” The principal part of it was collected by John Giudice, a botanist
                at Nice, and a friend of Allioni, to whom he bequeathed his papers. 5. “<q
                    date="1762">Synopsis methodica horti Taurinensis,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">
                1762</date>, 4to, a methodical catalogue of the plants in the botanic garden of
                Turin, divided into thirteen classes. 6. “<q date="1785">Flora Pedemontana, sive
                enumeratio
                    methodica stirpium indigenarum Pedemontii,</q>” Turin, <date event="work">1785</date>,
                3 vols. fol. This splendid work, which is illustrated with ninety-two plates, was
                the fruit of long labour and study, and added greatly to the author’s reputation. In
                it he describes 2813 plants, which he found growing wild in the duchy of Piedmont,
                of which those in the third volume are new. It has been, however, said, that those
                already known acquire a kind of novelty by his descriptions, which are drawn from
                nature, and not from books; and the work derives an additional value, especially on
                the spot, from the very cautious manner in which he speaks of the medical properties
                of any of these plants. The arrangement resembles that of Haller in his history of
                the Swiss plants. Haller had a great regard for Allioni, and corresponded with him
                till his death. 7. “<q date="1789">Auctuarium ad Flora Pedemontana,</q>” Turin, <date
                    event="work">1789</date>, containing some additions and corrections to the
                former. Besides these works, he wrote several papers in the memoirs of the academy
                of Turin; and from all his writings seems to deserve an honourable place among those
                who have contributed to the advancement of the botanical and medical sciences.
                Loeffling consecrated a genus to his memory, under the name of Allionia, which
                Linnæus has adopted. It is a genus of the monogynia order belonging to the
                tetrandria class of plants.</p>

            <p>, called <csc>Galanino</csc>, an eminent painter of history and portraits, received
                his education in the school of the Caracci, and in all his compositions retained the
                admirable style of his master. He had naturally a melancholy turn of mind, and was
                of a retired and solitary disposition: this induced him to avoid the conversation of
                his friends, and devote himself to the study of his art; but by this plan he became
                so necessitous, that he was compelled to paint portraits to procure a subsistence.
                In this branch, however, his success was astonishing; and he grew into the highest
                esteem, not only for the resemblance visible at first sight, and the beauty of his
                colouring, but also for a new and unusual boldness of manner, by which his portraits
                seemed absolutely to breathe. None of his contemporaries could enter into
                competition with him; and the Italian writers place him in the same rank of merit
                with Vandvck. He was born at Bologna in 1578, and died in 1638.</p>

            <p>, called <csc>Bronzing</csc>, an eminent painter, was born at Florence in 1535, and
                was the disciple of Agnolo Bronzino, likewise a distinguished painter, who educated
                him with all the tenderness of a parent, Allori having been deprived of his own
                father, when he was but five years old. He was very studious, and applied himself
                diligently, not only to imitate the manner of his master, but the different manners
                of those masters who were in the greatest reputation. When he commenced painter, his
                first work was a crucifixion, intended for an altar-piece, which was much praised,
                but his success in portrait-painting induced him to employ a great deal of his time
                in that branch. Michael Angelo was the master whose works he studied with the
                greatest attention, and he designed a picture of the Last Judgment, after the manner
                of that great genius, which is preserved at Rome, and will perpetuate the honour of
                Allori. He died in 1607, aged 72. It is said that he wrote some burlesque poems, and
                a dialogue on Design. The existence of this last is denied by his French biographer,
                but we find its title in Haym’s Biblioteca Italiana, “<q date="1590">Dialogo di

                education among the Jesuits, was sent to the Indies, where, having completed his
                studies, he became rector of the college of Bacaim. In 1622, Vitteleschi, general of
                the Jesuits, sent him as ambassador to the king of Abyssinia, who received him with
                much respect; but his successor having banished the Jesuits from his dominions,
                Almeida returned to Goa in 1634, and became provincial of his order in India, and

                    Ethiopia,</q>” to which his brother Jesuit, Bathazar Tellez, added many facts
                and documents, and published it at Coimbra, 1660, fol. 2. "<!--*BLOB*--> Historical letters/'

                entitled “<q>Itecreaceo Filosofica,</q>” 5 vols. 8vo, 1751, occasioned a revolution
                in the philosophical studies of the Portugueze, and would probably have involved the
                author in much danger, had not the Jesuits been soon after banished from that
                kingdom. He was nevertheless a zealous advocate for the pretensions of the court of
                Rome, at the time of the famous rupture between Joseph <sc>II</sc>. and that court;
                and this rendered him so obnoxious to the marquis de Pombal, that he was obliged to

                Portugal, the royal academy of sciences of Lisbon was eager to admit him a member;
                but it was soon evident that Almeida had not kept pace with the progress which the
                nation had made in twenty-five years, and he was suffered to eclipse himself,
                although without losing any of the respect due to his former services in promoting
                liberal science. He published, after his return to Lisbon, a moral romance, called “<q>The
                Happy Independant,</q>” which had little success; and it was said that a better
                title would have been “<q date="1805">The
                    Happy Impertinent.</q>” He died in <date event="work">1805</date>, leaving
                behind him several manuscripts, for the publication of which he had obtained the
                permission of the Censor. His works altogether are said to amount to forty volumes,
                besides five of translations; but we have not been able to obtain a list of their
                titles or subjects. At the time of his death he was a member of the Royal Academy of
                Lisbon, and of the Royal Society of London.</p>

            <p>, a priest of the oratory, was born at Brescia, of a noble family, Nov. 2, 1714, and
                studied theology, and the Greek and Hebrew languages, in both which he became an
                excellent scholar. He applied himself chiefly to an investigation of the text of the
                sacred scriptures, and read with great care the Greek and Latin fathers. His studies
                were also diversified by an acquaintance with chronology, history both sacred and
                profane, antiquities, criticism, and whatever belongs to the character of a general
                scholar. In his own country, he obtained such fame that his advice was thought to be
                oracular. He died Dec. 30, 1779, in his sixty-fifth year. He published “<q>Critical

        <body>
            <p>, king of Leon and Castile, who has been surnamed The Wise, on account of his
                attachment to literature, is now more celebrated for having been an astronomer than
                a king. He was born in 1203, succeeded his father Ferdinand <sc>III</sc>. in 12S2,
                and died in 1284, consequently at the age of 81. The affairs of the reign of
                Alphon&amp;us were very extraordinary and unfortunate, but we shall here only
                consider him in that part of his character, on account of which he has a place in
                this work, namely, as an astronomer and a man of letters. He acquired a profound
                knowledge of astronomy, philosophy, and history, and composed books upon the motions
                of the heavens, and on the history of Spain, which are highly commended. “<q>What
                    can be more surprising,</q>” says Mariana, “<q>than that a prince, educated in a
                camp, and
                    handling arms from his childhood, should have such a
                    knowledge of the stars, of philosophy, and the transactions
                    of the world, as men of leisure can scarcely acquire in
                    their retirements? There are extant some books of Alphonsus on the motions of
                    the stars, and the history of Spain,
                    written with great skill and incredible care.</q>” In his astronomical pursuits
                he discovered that the tables of Ptolemy were full of errors, and was the first to
                undertake the task of correcting them. For this purpose, about the year 1240, and
                during the life of his father, he assembled at Toledo the most skilful astronomers
                of his time, Christians, Moors, or Jews, when a plan was formed for constructing new
                tables. This task was accomplished about 1252, the first year of his reign; the
                tables being drawn up chiefly by the skill and pains of Rabbi Isaac Ha/an, a learned
                Jew, and the work called the Alphonsine Tables, in honour of the prince, who was at
                vast expences concerning them. He fixed the epoch of the tables to the 30th of May
                1252, being the day of his accession to the throne. They were printed for the first
                time in 1483, at Venice, by Radtolt, who excelled in printing at that time; an
                edition extremely rare: there are others of 1492, 1521, 1545, &amp;c. </p>
            <p>We must not omit a memorable saying of Alphonsus, which has been recorded for its
                boldness and impiety; namely, “<q>That if he had been of God’s privy council when
                    he made the world, he could have advised him better.</q>” His biographers have
                endeavoured to vindicate him in this instance, by assuring us that he meant only to
                reflect on. the absurd philosophy by which the laws of nature were then explained.
                Perhaps their wiser course would have been to consign it to oblivion, as there is no
                direct proof of his not having used this irreverent language.</p>

        <body>
            <p>, the reviver of industry and commerce in Sweden, was born in 1685, in the small town
                of Alingsas in West Gothland, of poor parents. After struggling for a long time with
                the evils of want, he came to London, where he paid particular attention to
                commercial speculations; and from his inquiries into the prosperity of England, he
                deduced the importance of manufactures and commerce. His native country, for several
                centuries engaged in war, had made little progress in the arts of industry, but was
                now endeavouring to promote them; and Alstroemer having formed his plan, returned to
                Sweden to assist his fellow-citizens in this undertaking. In 1723, he requested of
                the states a licence to establish manufactures in the town in which he was born, and
                it soon became the seat of activity and industry, which spread over other parts of
                the kingdom. In the mean time he travelled to acquire a knowledge of the inventions
                and the methods practised in Germany, Holland, and Flanders, collected able workmen,
                and the best models, and published several instructive papers. At the same time he
                carried on trade, in partnership with Nicholas Sahlgren, at Gottenburgh. Here he
                established a sugar-house, traded to the Indies and the Levant, and bestowed so much
                attention on rural opconomy, as to introduce some very essential improvements,
                cultivating plants proper for dying, and extending the culture of potatoes, then a
                novelty in Sweden. He also improved the wool-trade by importing the sheep of Spain
                and England, and even the Angora goat. The manufacture of cloth, and other articles
                from wool, was now much encouraged, and gave employment to a great number of hands,
                who manufactured to the value of three millions of livres tournois per annum, and
                relieved the country from the necessity of having recourse to foreign markets; but
                in other manufactures, as the silk, then did not succeed so well. Alstroemer has
                been accused of not paying sufficient attention to local circumstances in some of
                his schemes, and of having encouraged notions that were more showy than solid; but
                his design was truly patriotic, and his country readily acknowledged the benefit it
                has derived from his labours. The king Frederic bestowed on him the title of
                counsellor of commerce, and the order of the polar star; Adolphus Frederic granted
                him letters of nobility; and the academy of sciences chose him a member, while the
                States decreed that his statue should be placed on the exchange at Stockholm, with
                this inscription: “<q>Jonas Alstjoemer,
                    artium fabrilium in patria instaurator.</q>” “<q date="1761">J. A. the reviver
                    of manufactures.</q>” He died in <date event="work">1761</date>, leaving a
                considerable fortune. His four sons, Claude, Patrick, John, Augustus, were
                distinguished for talents and patriotism, and the first three were members of the
                academy of Stockholm.</p>

                whence he sent some plants to Linnæus, who mentions him in his “<q>Species
                plantaruni.</q>” On landing at Cadiz, he saw in the house of the Swedish consul the
                flowers of a plant, a native of Peru. Struck with their beauty, he asked and
                obtained some seeds, which he immediately dispatched to Linnseus, with whom they
                succeeded, and became generally cultivated under the name of the lily of
                Alstroetner, or of the Incas. Linnæus perpeiuated the name by -Galling the genus
                Alstrpemeria. Alstroemer communicated with several societies for agriculture and
                natural history, but one paper only is mentioned of his in the memoirs of the
                academy of Stockholm, giving a description of the Simia Mammon, a species of, ape.
                He died in 1794.</p>

                died at Vienna March 29, 1804. He entered the society of the Jesuits, and was Greek
                teacher in the school of St. Anne, and the academy of Vienna, until his death. He
                has published two hundred and fifty volumes and dissertations, the titles of which
                are given in J. G. Meusel’s Allemagne Savante. One of his principal publications was
                “<q date="1786">Novum Testamentum, ad codicem Vindobonensem
                    Græce expressum: varietatem lectionis addidit Franc.

                8vo. The groundwork of this edition is the codex Lambecii in the imperial library at
                Vienna, with which the author has collated other manuscripts in that library, and
                the Coptic, Sclavonic, and Latin versions; the latter from the valuable fragments of
                the Vulgate, anterior to that of Jerome. It is thought that he would have succeeded
                better, if he had adopted as a basis the text of Wetstein or Griesbach, and if he
                had been more fortunate in arranging his materials. The merits of this edition are
                examined, with his usual acuteness, by Dr. Herbert Marsh in his supplement to
                Michaelis’s introduction to the New Testament. Of Alter’s other works, those in most

                His merit as a painter appears to have been very considerable, but much more as a
                designer and engraver. His works in wood and metal are as numerous as, in general,
                remarkable for diminutive size, though neither his conceptions nor forms were puny.

                a sensibility of mind, and a boldness of design, which perhaps none of his German
                contemporaries can boast. Holbein is said to have drawn great assistance from him,
                evident traces of the style of Altorfer appearing in the prints of that inimitable
                artist, although certainly much improved.</p>

            <p> a Prussian statesman, knight of the orders of the red and black eagle, lord of
                Hundisburgh, &amp;c. was born Dec. 12, 1745, at Hanover, where his father was
                counsellor of war. During the seven years war he was brought up at Magdebourg with
                the prince, afterwards Frederic-William <sc>II</sc>. He then studied law at the
                university of Halle, and was appointed referendary in the court of accounts at
                Berlin, and in 1775, was sent as envoy extraordinary to the elector of Saxony, with
                the title of king’s chamberlain. This proved the commencement of a diplomatic
                career, for which he was thought qualified by his extensive knowledge and
                accomplishments, and the address with which he retained the good opinion of Frederic <sc>
                II</sc>. During the war for the succession of Bavaria, he acted as intermediate
                agent between the king of Prussia and the old electorate court, and between the army
                of Frederic and that of Prince Henry. After having been engaged in this office for
                twelve years, he was sent as ambassador, in 1787, to the court of France. In 1788 he
                was sent, in the same capacity, to Holland and in 1789 to England. In 1790 he was
                recalled from the latter, and appointed minister for foreign affairs, and his zeal
                and activity rendered him highly acceptable in the court of Berlin. During his
                administration he founded several benevolent establishments. He died at Berlin in
                1802. As a writer he is known by a historical work entitled “<q date="1792">Essai

            <p> a modern German poet, was born at Vienna, Jan. 24, 1755; his father was a civilian,
                and consistory counsellor to the bishop of Passau, He studied the classics under the
                celebrated antiquary Eckhel, keeper of the medals at Vienna, and while with him,
                imbibed such a taste for reading-the ancient poets, that he knew most of their
                writings by heart, and was always so fond of this study, that he remembered with
                gratitude, to the last hour of his life, the master who had initiated him in it, nor
                did he neglect his favourite authors, even when obliged to attend the courts of law.
                When the death of his parents had put him in possession of a considerable patrimony,
                he made no other use of his doctor’s and advocate’s titles, than in reconciling the
                differences of such clients as addressed themselves to him for advice. His first
                poetical attempts appeared in the Muses’ Almanack, and other periodical publications
                at Vienna, and of these he published a collection at Leipsic in 1784, and at
                Klagenfurth in 1788, which procured him the honour of being ranked among the best
                poets of his country for elegance, energy, and fertility of imagination. In the “<q
                    date="1794">New Collection of Poetry,</q>” printed at Vienna in <date
                    event="work">1794</date>, he contributed some pieces not so favourable to his
                character; but he completely re-established his fame by the publication of “<q>Doolin
                of Mentz,</q>” and “<q>Bliomberis,</q>” two poems of the romantic cast, in imitation
                of.Wieland, to whom the last was dedicated. In 1791, he published a German
                translation of Florian’s “<q>Numa Pompilius,</q>” which some have thought equal to
                the original, but in many parts it is deficient in elegance. It was, however, his
                last performance, except the assistance he gave to some literary contemporaries in
                translating the foreign journals. During the three last years of his life, he was
                secretary and inspector of the&gt; court theatre, and died May 1, 1797, of a nervous
                fever. He was a man of warm affections and gaiety of temper, and of his liberality
                he afforded a striking instance in the case of Haschka the poet, whom he regarded as
                one of the cipal supporters of German literature. He not only ac commodated him with
                apartments in his house, but made him a present of 10,000 florins. Of his faults, it
                is only recorded that he was a little vain, and a little given to the pleasures of
                the table.</p>

            <p>, the son of Gregory Amaseo, Latin professor at Venice, was one of the most
                celebrated Italian scholars of the sixteenth century. He was born at Udina in 1489,
                and educated at first by his father and uncle, but finished his studies at Padua,
                and in 1508 had begun to teach the belles lettres there, when the war, occasioned by
                the league at Cambray, obliged him to leave the place. He then went to Bologna,
                continued to teach, and married, and had children, and was so much respected that
                the city admitted him as a citizen, an honour which his ancestors had also enjoyed.
                In 1530, he was appointed first secretary to the senate, and was chosen by pope
                Clement <sc>VII</sc>. to pronounce before him and Charles V. a Latin harangue on the
                subject of the peace concluded at Bologna between the two sovereigns. This he
                accordingly performed, with great applause, in the church of St. Petrona, before a
                numerous audience of the first rank. He continued to teach at Bologna, with
                increasing popularity, until 1543, when he was invited to Rome by pope Paul <sc>III</sc>.
                and his nephew cardinal Alexander Farnese. The pope employed him in many political
                missions to the court of the emperor, those of the German princes, and that of the
                king of Poland; and in 1550, after the death of his wife, pope Julius <sc>III</sc>.
                appointed him secretary of the briefs, a place which he did not long enjoy, as he
                died in 1552. He wrote Latin translations of “<q date="1533">Xenophon’s Cyrus,</q>”
                Bologna, <date event="work">1533</date>, fol. and of “<q date="1547">Pausanias,</q>”
                Rome, <date event="work">1547</date>, 4to; and a volume entitled “<q>Orationes,</q>”
                consisting of eighteen Latin speeches on various occasions, Bonon. 1580, 4to. His
                contemporaries bestow the highest praises on his learning and eloAlienee. His son <csc>
                Pompilio</csc> had perhaps less reputation, but he too distinguished himself as
                Greek professor at Bologna, where he died in 1584. He translated two fragments of
                Polybius, Bologna, 1543, and wrote a history of his own time in Latin, which has not
                been published.</p>

            <p>, a miscellaneous French writer,
                who, in his works, assumed the title of signior de Chevillon, was the natural son of
                Chaumont d'Amboise,
                admiral of France, and lieutenant-general in Lombarcly. He
                was born at Naples in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and was educated with
                the legitimate son of hig
                father, but the latter died suddenly, in 1511, before he
                had made any provision for Michael. He then went to
                Paris, and was intended for the profession of the law, but
                was so attached to poetry, although his first performances
                were unsuccessful, that he could not be prevailed on to
                study law, and his friends abandoned him. He married
                also imprudently, and his accumulated disappointments
                and distresses are supposed to have shortened his life. He
                died in 1547. Niceron has given a large catalogue of his
                works, all nominally poetical, but without any characteristics of the art, and which
                probably procured him some
                small degree of reputation, chiefly from the rapidity with
                which he wrote and published.</p>

            <p>, an eminent Italian scholar, was born at Florence, June 13, 1713, and died at Rome
                in 1788, where he had been professor of eloquence for thirty years with great
                reputation. Most of the present Italian literati are indebted to him for their taste
                for study and the happy manner in which he taught them to employ their talents. He
                published a “<q>Translation of Virgil into
                    blank verse,</q>” of which the edition printed at Rome, 3 vols. fol. 1763, a
                most superb book, is very scarce: he translated likewise some of the tragedies of
                Voltaire, Florence, 1752, and a selection of Cicero’s epistles; he published a Latin
                oration on the election of Joseph <sc>II</sc>. to be king of the Romans; but he is
                principally known for the “<q>Museum Kicheranum,</q>” in 2 vols. folio, 1765. The
                care of this valuable museum was long confided to him, and he prevailed upon the
                learned cardinal De Zelada to enrich it by his collections. He left in manuscript, a
                Latin poem on the cultivation of the lemon-tree. One other publication remains to be
                noticed; his translation of the Jesuit Noceti’s two poems on the Iris and the Aurora
                Borealis, which were printed in the same magnificent manner with his Virgil.</p>

            <p>, a pious and learned capuchin, whose family name was la Peirie, was born at Lombez
                in 1708, and died the 25th of October 1778, at St. Saviour, near Bareges, at the age
                of 70. His order was sensible to his merit, and he was successively professor of
                theology, guardian, and definitor. His tract on “<q>Inward Peace,</q>” and his “<q>Lettres
                Spirituelles,</q>” each in one vol. 12mo, are said by persons of his communion, to
                be full of light and unction, and breathe that gentle piety that characterised their
                author. We are told by pere Mayeul, that he had great talents as a spiritual
                director, and was an instrument in the hand of God for converting sinners, and
                consoling the just. Fere Ambrose had by nature a self-love by far too sensible, with
                an exuberance of delicacy, and an ardent desire of public esteem: but an adherence
                to the precepts of the gospel effectually cured him of all these defects. To his
                native pride he opposed humility and self-contempt. “<q>It is self-love,</q>” said
                he, “<q>that corrupts our virtues, and spoils our happiness. Of
                    a hundred things that offend us in society, ninety-nine
                    were never meant to offend. But pride takes all things in
                    their strictest rigour.</q>” “<q>Let it take things,</q>” added he, “<q>as it
                will; I will suffer all. If they should spit in my
                    face, have I not a handkerchief to wipe it off?</q>”</p>

            <p>, an Italian lawyer and miscellaneous writer, was born at Naples in 1659, and for the
                first fourteen years of his life, was obliged to be confined in a dark room, owing
                to a complaint in his eyes. On his recovery, he made very rapid progress in general
                science, went through a course of law, and had very considerable practice at Naples.
                His leisure hours he dedicated to polite literature, and particularly cultivated the
                Tuscan language, which he wrote with the greatest purity, and used in all his works.
                He died at Naples, July 21, 1719. His principal writings are, 1. Seven prose
                comedies, La Costanza, H Forca, la Fante, &amp;c. which are, Baretti says, perhaps
                the wittiest we have in Italian; but the author makes some of his actors appear
                masked and speak the different dialects of Italy, especially the Neapolitan. 2. “<q

                advertisements, but unlike them in their subjects, which are matters of literature
                and literary history. 3. “<q>

                    event="work">1700</date>, 12mo; which last, translated into French, is inserted

                    des sourds et muets,</q>” 1779, 12tno. Amman also published a good edition of
                the works of Ccelius Aurelianus, 1709, 4to, with Janson D'Almeloveen’s notes. He
                died at Marmund, in Holland, in 1724. His son, <csc>John</csc>, born in 1707, was
                also a physician, but particularly skilled in Botany, on which he gave lectures at
                Petersburgh, where he was elected a member of the academy of sciences. He was also a
                member of the Royal Society of London. Being desirous of extending the knowledge of
                those plants which Gmelin and other travellers had discovered in the different
                countries of Asiatic Russia, he published “<q date="1739">Stirpium rariorum in

                which would have been followed by another volume, if the author had not died in the
                prime of life, in 1740.</p>

            <p>, a painter and engraver,
                was born at Zurich, June 1539. His youth and studies
                are involved in obscurity, and the first notice we have of
                him is in 1560, when he went to Nuremberg, where he was
                admitted a burgess, and where he died in 1591. Here he
                began in designs on wood, paper, and copper, that career
                of incessant and persevering exertion which over-ran all
                Germany. History, allegory, emblem, sciences, trades,
                arts, professions, rural sports, heraldry, portrait, fashions,
                were all served in their turns, and often served so well,
                that his inventions may still be consulted by the artist with
                advantage. He painted with great brilliancy on glass.
                His drawings hatched with the pen, or washed, have Italian
                characteristics of style and execution.
            </p>
            <p>The multitude of designs which he made, and the number of plates which he engraved,
                are incredible. He lived at a time when almost every book which made its appearance
                was ornamented with prints, and he was employed mostly by the great booksellers,
                especially by Feyeraband. There are editions of Livy, Tacitus, Diogenes Laertius,
                and many other classics, with his prints. His portraits of the kings of France, with
                short memoirs, appeared in 1576. He engraved also for the New Testament, and a “<q
                    date="1586">Theatrum nmlierum,</q>” Francfort, <date event="work">1586</date>,
                4to. One of his most curious works is the “<q date="1564">Panoplia omnium
                    liberalium,
                    mechanic-drum et sedentiarium artium genera continens,</q>” Francfort, <date
                    event="work">1564</date>, a collection of one hundred and fifteen plates,
                exhibiting the various artificers at work. In the plate of the art of engraving, he
                introduced a portrait of himself.</p>

            <p>, a learned German physician and botanist, was born at Breslaw in 1634. After
                studying in various German universities, he travelled to Holland and England,
                received his doctor’s degree at Leipsic, and was admitted a member of the society of
                natural history (l'academie de curieux de la nature) under the 1 name of Dryander.
                In 1674, an extraordinary professorship was established for him, from which he-was
                promoted to that of botany, and in 1682, to that of physiology. Amman was a man of a
                lively and somewhat turbulent cast, and although all his writings discover great
                learning and talents in his profession, yet he is often harsh in his remarks on
                others, fond of paradox, and affects a jocular humour not very well suited to the
                nature of the subjects on which he treats. His first work was a critical extract
                from the different decisions in the registers of the faculty of Leipsic, Erfurt,
                1670, 4to; on which they thought proper to pass a public censure, in their answer
                published in the same year, under the title “<q>Facultatis medicse Lipsiensis
                excusatio, &amp;c.</q>” His other productions were, 1. “<q date="1673">Paraenesis
                    ad docentes occupata circa institutionum medicarum emendationem,</q>”
                Rudulstadt, <date event="work">1673</date>, 12mo, a vehement invective against
                medical systems, especially the Galenic, in which he certainly points out errors and
                abuses; but, as Haller observes, without pointing out any thing better. Leichner and
                others wrote against this work, whom he answered, in 2. “<q date="1674">Archaeas
                syncopticus, Eccardi Leichneri,
                    &amp;c. oppositus,</q>” <date event="work">1674</date>, 12mo. 3. “<q date="1689">Irenicum

                    vindicantur,</q>” Francfort, <date event="work">1689</date>, 8vo, a work of a
                satirical cast, and much in the spirit of the former. 4, “<q date="1690">Praxis
                vulnerurn lethalium,</q>” Francfort, <date event="work">1690</date>, 8vo. As a

                naturalis plantarum,</q>” <date event="work">1676</date>, a work which, entitles him
                to rank among those who have most ably contributed to the advancement of the science
                of botany as we now have it. Nebel published an improved edition of this work in
                1700. Amman, whom, we may add, Haller characterises as a man of a caustic turn, and
                somewhat conceited, died in 1691, in his fifty-fifth year.</p>

            <p>, a celebrated architect and sculptor, was born at Florence in 1511, and was at first
                the scholar of Baccio Bandinelli, and then of Sansovino at Venice; but on his return
                to his own country, he studied with much enthusiasm the sculptures of Michael Angelo
                in the chapel of St. Laurence. His first works are at Pisa; for Florence he executed
                a Leda, and about the same time, for Naples, the three figures, large as life, on
                the tomb of the poet Sannazarius. Meeting with some unpleasant circumstances here,
                he returned to Venice, and made the colossal Neptune, which is in St. Mark’s place.
                At Padua he made another colossal statue, of Hercules, which is still in the Montava
                palace, and has been engraved. He then went to Rome to study the antique, and pope
                Julius <sc>III</sc>. employed him in works of sculpture in the capitol. Some time
                after, in conjunction withVasari, he erected the tomb of cardinal de Monti, which
                added very considerably to his fame. Besides these, he executed a great number of
                works for Rome, Florence, and other places. The porticoes of the court of the palace
                Pitti are by him, as well as the bridge of the Trinity, one of the finest structures
                that have been raised since the revival of the arts, the facade of the Roman
                college, and the palace Rupsoli on the Corso. This architect composed a large work,
                entitled “<q>La Cita,</q>” comprising designs for all the public edifices necessary
                to a great city. This book, after having passed successively through several hands,
                was presented some time in the eighteenth century to prince Ferdinand of Tuscany,
                and it is now among the collection of designs in the gallery of Florence, after
                having been long inquired after, and supposed to be lost. After the death of his
                wife, he devoted the greater part of his wealth to pious purposes, and died himself
                in 1592. His wife, Laura Battiferri, an Italian lady of distinguished genius and
                learning, was the daughter of John. Antony Battiferri, and was born at Urbino in
                1513. She spent her whole life in the study of philosophy and polite literature, and
                is esteemed one of the best Italian poets of the sixteenth century. The principal
                merit of her poems, “<q date="1560">L'Opere Toscane,</q>” <date event="work">1560</date>,
                consists in a noble elevation, their being filled with excellent morals, and their
                breathing a spirit of piety. The academy of Intronati, at Sienna, chose her one of
                their members. She died in November 1589, at seventy-six years of age.</p>

            <p>, a dissenting divine, was born at Hinckley in Leicestershire in 1736, and was for
                many years a preacher at Hampstead, near London, and afterwards at Coseley, in
                Staffordshire, from which he retired in his latter days to his native town, where he
                died June 8, 1803. He was a man of some learning in biblical criticism, as appears
                by his various publications on theological subjects. He wrote, 1. “<q date="1774">An
                account of the occasion and

                on the inspiration and authority of the Scripture itself; on some peculiarities in
                St. Paul’s Epistles; on the prophecies of Daniel and St. John, &amp;c. To which are
                added, some strictures on the prophecies of Isaiah,"<!--*BLOB*--> 1798, 8vo. In this work, which
                is as devoid of elegance of style, as of strength of argument, and which shows how
                far a man may go, to whom all established belief is obnoxious, the inspiration of
                the New Testament writers is questioned, the genuineness of the Apocalypse is
                endeavoured to be invalidated; and the evangelical predictions of Isaiah are
                transferred from the Messiah to the political history of our own times. The most
                singular circumstance of the personal history of Mr. Amner, was his incurring the
                displeasure of George Steevens, the celebrated commentator on Shakspeare. This he
                probably did very innocently, for Mr. Steevens was one of those men who wanted no
                motives for revenge or malignity but what he found in his own breast. He had,
                however, contracted a dislike to Mr. Amner, who was his neighbour at Hampstead, and
                marked him out as the victim of a species of malignity which, we believe, has no
                parallel. This was his writing several notes to the indecent passages in Shakspeare,
                in a gross and immoral style, and placing Mr. Amner’s name to them. These appeared
                first in the edition of 1793, and are still continued.</p>

            <p>, an associate of Luther in the reformation, was born in 1483, near Wurtzen in
                Misnia, of a noble family. After studying divinity, he became one of the clergy of
                Wittemberg, and preached also at Magdeburgh and Naumburgh. In 1527, he accompanied
                Luther, to whose doctrines he was zealously attached, to the diet of Worms, and on
                his return, was in the same carriage with that reformer, when he was seized by order
                f the elector of Saxony, and conducted to Wartburgh. In 1573, he concurred in
                drawing up the articles of Smalcalde, and was, in 1542, appointed bishop of
                Naumburgh by the elector John Frederick, who disapproved of the choice which the
                chapter had made of Julius de Pflug. But, five years after, when his patron was
                taken prisoner by Charles V. he was obliged to surrender the bishopric to Pflug, and
                retire to Magdeburgh. He afterwards assisted in founding the university of Jena,
                which was intended as a rival to that of Wirtemberg, and died at Eisenach, May 14,
                1565. The principal thing objected to him by the popish writers, and by some of his
                biographers, is, that in a dispute with G. Major, he maintained that good works were
                hurtful to salvation: but however improper this expression in the heat of debate, it
                is evident from his writings, that he meant that good works impeded salvation by
                being relied on as the cause of it, and that they were the fruit and effect of that
                faith to which pardon is promised. He was one of the boldest in his time in
                asserting the impiety and absurdity of the principal popish doctrines, but from his
                bigotted adherence to Lutheran principles, had too little respect for the other
                reformers who were of different sentiments in some points. Moreri is wrong in
                asserting that he formed a sect called by his name. Thesame principles were held by
                many of the Lutheran divinos. He wrote on the “<q>Lord’s Supper,</q>” and some other
                controversial pieces enumerated by JVlelchior Adam, Joecher, and Adelung.</p>

            <p>, an eminent French actor and dramatic writer, was born at Fontainbleau, Nov. 1,
                1661. He studied in the Jesuits’ college at Paris, under father de la Rue; who,
                discovering in him a remarkable quickness and capacity for learning, was extremely
                desirous of engaging him in their order, but d'Ancourt’s aversion to a religious
                life rendered all his efforts ineffectual. After he had gone through a course of
                philosophy, he applied himself to the civil law, and was admitted advocate at
                seventeen years of age, but falling in love with an actress, he went upon the stage;
                and, in 1680, married this woman. As he had all the qualifications necessary for the
                theatre, he soon greatly distinguished himself, and began to write pieces for the
                stage, many of which had such success, that most of the players grew rich from the
                profits of them. His merit in this way procured him a very favourable reception at
                court, where Lewis <sc>XIV</sc>. shewed him many marks of his favour. Ais sprightly
                conversation and polite behaviour made his company agreeable to all the men of
                figure both at court and in the city, and the most considerable persons were
                extremely pleased to have him at their houses. Having taken a journey to Dunkirk, to
                see his eldest daughter who lived there, he took the opportunity of paying his
                compliments to the elector of Bavaria, who was then at Brussels. This prince
                received him with the utmost civility; and, having retained him a considerable time,
                dismissed him, with a present of a diamond valued at a thousand pistoles; he
                likewise rewarded him in a very generous manner, when, upon his coming to Paris,
                d'Ancourt composed an entertainment for his diversion. At length grown weary of the
                theatre, which he quitted in Lent, 1718, he retired to his estate of Courcelles le
                Roy, in Berry; where he applied himself wholly to devotion, and composed a
                translation of David’s psalms in verse, and a sacred tragedy, which were never
                printed. He died the 16th of December, 1726, 65 years of age. His plays consist of
                fifty-two, of which twentyfive are said to keep their reputation on the stage. They
                were published in 1710 and 1750, in 9 vols. 12mo, and the best of them in 3 vols.
                12mo, under the title of “<q>Chefsd‘œuvre de d’Ancourt.</q>”</p>

            <p>, a learned German, and a member of the Imperial Academy, was born at Hamburgh, March
                14, 1674. His father was a rich merchant, who spared no expence in cultivating his
                talents, which were particularly directed to the study of the canon law, languages,
                and natural history, which he studied at Halle, Leipsic, and Leyden. Soon after his
                father’s death, in 1708, he was appointed syndic of the republic of Hamburgh, was
                employed in various negociations with the princ-ipal courts of Europe, and was
                always eager to make himself acquainted with whatever was interesting in the
                countries he visited. On his return in 1725 he was made burgomaster, and chief of
                the city and territory of Hamburgh; a situation which, however, did not interrupt
                his studies, nor his correspondence with the learned of Germany and France. He
                studied especially the history of the northern nations, not contenting himself with
                what had been published, but visited them; and not only acquired more knowledge than

            <p>, a German apothecary of considerable learning and excellent character, was born at
                Hanover in 1724; studied first at Berlin, and afterwards passed a few years in the
                principal German and Dutch universities. He resided likewise some time in England,
                and formed an acquaintance, in the course of his various travels, with the most
                eminent physicians and chemists of the age. On his return to Hanover, he succeeded
                to his father’s business, who was an apothecary; and published from time to time, in
                the Hanoverian Magazine, many learned and useful dissertations on medical and
                chemical subjects, and formed a very fine museum of natural history; of which, at
                his death, he left a catalogue raisonne. In 1765, by desire of his Britannic
                majesty, he undertook an examination of the different kinds of earth in the
                electorate of Hanover, and published the result in 1769, under the title of “<q

            <p>, bishop of Aleria in Corsica, has
                established a name in the literary world, not so much by
                his original compositions, as by the care he bestowed in
                superintending many valuable works, when the invention
                of printing was introduced at Rome, by those celebrated
                printers Conrad Sweignheym, and Arnould Pannartz.
                His family name was Bussi, or Bossi, and he was born at
                Vigevano in 1417: after having resided for many years at,
                Rome in a state of poverty and neglect, he obtained the
                patronage of the cardinal de Cusa, who procured for him
                the place of secretary to the Vatican library, and then the
                bishopric of Accia, in the island of Corsica; from which
                he was translated not long after to that of Aleria. Some
                biographers, mistaking him for John Andreas, the canonist, have attributed to him
                writings on the Decretals; we
                have nothing of his, however, that can be deemed original,
                except the valuable prefaces prefixed to the editions which
                he corrected and superintended in the press. He died in
                1475. He was particularly instrumental in introducing
                the art of printing into Italy, and fixing it at Rome. The
                printers above-mentioned were under his immediate protection, and in his prefaces he
                considers them as under
                his care. The works he superintended were, in 1468 9,
                1. Epistolae Ciceronis ad Familiares. 2. Hieronymi Epistolrc. 3. Julius Caesar. 4.
                Livy. 5. Virgil. 6. Lucan.
                7. Aulus Gellius. 8. Apuleius; and in 1470 1, 9. Lactantius. 10. Cicero’s Orations.
                11. S. Biblia. 12. Cyprianus. 13. S. Leon. Mag. Sermones et Epistolne. 14. Ovidii
                Metamorph. 15. Pliny. 16. Quintilian. 17. Suetonius.
                18. Ciceronis Epist. ad Attic; and Lyra in Biblia, and
                Strabo, without date. Mr. Beloe, who has abridged many
                of Andreas’s prefaces, justly observes, that when the
                length of time is considered, which at the present day
                would be required to carry any one of the preceding works
                through the press, it seems astonishing, and hardly credible, that so much should
                have been accomplished in so
                very short a period.</p>

            <p>, wife to the preceding, was born at Padua in 1562, became an actress of great fame,
                and was flattered by the applauses of the men of wit and learning in her time. She
                is described as a woman of elegant figure, beautiful countenance, and melodious
                voice, of taste in her profession, and conversant with the French and Spanish
                languages; nor was she unacquainted with philosophy and the sciences. She was a
                votary of the muses, and cultivated poetry with ardour and success. The Intend,
                academicians of Pavia, conferred upon her the honours of their society, and the
                titles of Isabella Andreina, Comica Gelosa, Academica Intenta, delta l'Accesa. She
                dedicated her works to cardinal Cinthio Aldobrandini (nephew to Clement <sc>VIIL</sc>),
                by whom she was greatly esteemed, and for whom many of her poems were composed. </p>
            <p>In France, whither she made a tour, she met with the most flattering reception from
                the king, the queen, and the court. She composed several sonnets in praise of her
                royal patrons, which are inserted in the second volume of her poems. She married
                Francis Andreini, whom we have just noticed, and died at Lyons, June 10th, 1604, in
                consequence of a premature delivery during a state of pregnancy, in the forty
                -second year of her age. Her husband, whom her loss overwhelmed with affliction, had
                her interred in the city in which she expired, and erected a monument to her memory,
                on which he caused an epitaph to be inscribed, enumerating her virtues, her piety,
                and her talents. Her death was lamented in many Latin and Italian elegies and
                panegyrics, and even a medal was struck to her memory, with the inscription, “<q>JEterna
                Fama.</q>” The justice of these high praises may still be appreciated by a perusal
                of her works 1. “<q date="1588">Mirtilla, favola pastorale,</q>” Verona, <date
                    event="work">1588</date>, 8vo, and often reprinted. She is said to have begun
                this in her infancy, but it does not appear to have been very successful on the
                stage. 2. “<q date="1601">Rime,</q>” Milan, <date event="work">1601</date>, 4to;
                Paris, 1603, 12mo, &amp;c. Most of these had appeared in various collections, and
                there are others of her writing in “<q date="1726">Componimenti poetici delle piu

            <p>, an eminent Italian musician, wa born about the year 1736, and studied his art at
                Naples under the greatest masters. In 1771, Piccini, who had a friendship for him,
                procured him an engagement as composer for the theatre della Dame, at Rome. Here his
                first attempts were not very successful; yet he persisted, and in 1775, established
                his reputation completely by his “<q>Inconnue persecutee;</q>” “<q>La Finta
                Giardiniera;</q>” and “<q>
                    <sc>II</sc> Geloso in cimento;</q>” the merit of all which operas was amply
                acknowledged. The failure, however, of his “<q>Olympiade,</q>” and some other
                unpleasant circumstances, determined him to travel. Accordingly, he visited the
                principal cities of Italy, and came to Paris, with the title of master of the
                conservatory at Venice. He presented to the royal academy of music his “<q>Inconnue
                persecutee,</q>” adapted to French words, but it had not the same success as in
                Italy. In 1782 he came to London, to take the direction of the opera: but, as Dr.
                Burney observes, he arrived at an unfavourable time; for as Sacchini had preceded
                him, and as the winter folio wing was only rendered memorable at the opera-house by
                misfortunes, disgrace, and bankruptcy, his reputation was rather diminished than
                increased in this kingdom. In 1787, he finally settled at Rome, where his reputation
                was at its height, and continued unabated to the day of his death in 1795. Besides
                his operas, he composed some oratorios from words selected by Metastasio.</p>

            <p>, an English clergyman and nonconformist, was born about the latter end of the

                1610. After taking his degrees in arts, he went into the church, and became a
                frequent and popular preacher. In 1630 he preached a lecture at Leicester; but, in
                1634, was suspended by the dean of the arches for preaching without a licence. In
                1650, the Independents, who then were predominant, obliged him to leave Leicester,
                because he refused to subscribe to their engagement. On this the Mercers’ company
                chose him lecturer of Grantham in Lincolnshire, where he remained until his death in
                1655, an event which was deeply lamented by his flock. He wrote “<q date="1659">The

            <p>, a painter of considerable note in
                the last century, was born at Dunkirk in 1685, and visiting
                Flanders and Germany in the course of his studies, made
                the longest stay at Dusseldorpe, enchanted with the treasures of painting in that
                city. He came to England about
                the year 1712, and soon became a favourite painter; but
                in the year 1728, he set out for Italy, where he spent three
                years. At Rome his pictures gave great satisfaction, but
                being of a reserved temper, and not ostentatious of his
                merit, he disgusted several by the reluctance with which
                he exhibited his works; his studious and sober temper inclining him more to the
                pursuit of his art than to the advantage of his fortune. Yet his attention to the
                latter
                prevented his returning to England, as he intended; for,
                stopping at Rennes in Bretagne, a rich and parliamentary
                town, he was so immediately overwhelmed with employment there, that he settled in
                that city, and died there in a
                short time, in 1734, when he was not above forty nine
                years of age. He executed conversations and landscapes
                with small figures, which he was fond of enriching with representations of fruit and
                fish. His manner was a mixture
                of Teniers and Watteau, with more grace than the former,
                and more nature than the latter. His pencil was easy,
                bright, and flowing, but his colouring too faint and nerveless. He afterwards
                adopted the habits of Rubens and
                Vandyck, more picturesque indeed, but not so proper to
                improve his productions in what their chief beauty consisted, familiar life.</p>

                works. Of these, Francis executed the^ altar of Val de

                but we do not find him noticed by Walpole. He died at

                was the younger brother, born in 1612, executed the tomb

            <p>, one of the most celebrated Italian poets of the sixteenth century, was born about
                1517, at Sutri in Tuscany, of very poor parents. After receiving such education as
                he could afford, he came to Rome and engaged himself as a corrector of the press;
                but an intrigue with his master’s wife, in which he was detected, obliged him to
                leave Rome^with a little money and a few cloaths, of which he was stripped by
                robbers. He then begged his way to Vienna, and there got immediate employment from
                Franceschi, the bookseller; and, while with him, wrote his translation of Ovid, and
                some of his original works. He then returned to Rome, which his reputation as a poet
                had reached, but his misfortunes also followed him; and after having lived for some
                time on the sale of his cloaths and books, he died partly of hunger, and partly of a
                disease contracted by his imprudent conduct, in an inn near Torre de Nona. The exact
                date of his death is not known, but it appears by a letter addressed to him by
                Annibai Caro, that he was alive in 1564. His translation of the Metamorphoses still
                enjoys a high reputation in Italy, and Varchi and some other critics chuse to prefer
                it to the original. This is exaggerated praise, but undoubtedly the poetry and style
                are easy and elegant; although from the many liberties he has taken with the text,
                it ought rather to be called an imitation than a translation. The editions have been
                numerous, but the best is that of the Giunti, Venice, 1584, 4to, with engravings by

                one book only was printed, 1564, 4to; soon after which period it is supposed he
                died. His other works are: 1. “<q>CEdipo,</q>” a tragedy, partly original and partly
                from Sophocles. It had great success in representation, and was played in a
                magnificent temporary theatre built for the purpose by Palladio in 1565. 2. “<q>
                Canzoni,</q>” addressed to the dukes of Florence and Ferrara. 3. “<q>Poetical

                    Furioso. 4. Four</q>” Capitoli,"<!--*BLOB*--> or satires, printed in various collections of
                that description. It appears by these last that he was gay and thoughtless in the
                midst of all his misfortunes.</p>

            <p>, astronomer, geometrician, and mechanic, was the son of a labourer employed in
                agriculture. He was born Feb. 22, 1723, at Oberperfuss, a village about 12 miles
                from Inspruck, and died Sept. 1, 1766. While engaged in the menial employments of
                labourer and shepherd, he felt an irresistible impulse towards astronomy and
                geometry. Pere Hill, a Jesuit, professor in the university of Inspruck, discovered
                his talents, and enabled him to cultivate them with such success, that in a short
                time he became an able astronomer, and one of the best mechanics in Europe. He made
                a pair of globes for the university of Inspruck, which are acknowledged to be
                masterpieces in their kind. He constructed and completed a great variety of
                mathematical instruments, and drew maps and charts of admirable accuracy and
                neatness. Snatched away in the flower of his age from the arts and sciences, he was
                deservedly lamented by person’s of real knowledge. The empress-queen, whose subject
                he was, and who had granted him a pension of 200 florins, which he enjoyed but two
                months, settled a pension of 50 florins on his sister, to testify her consideration
                for the deceased. The maps which he left were published at Vienna in 1774, “<q

            <p>, dean of Edinburgh in Scotland,
                the son of William Annand, minister of Air, in Airshire,
                was born in that town in 1633. Five years after, his father
                was obliged to quit Scotland with his family, on account of
                their loyalty to the king, and adherence to the episcopal
                government established by law in that country. In 1651,
                young Annand was admitted a scholar in University -college, Oxford; and though he
                was put under the care of a
                Presbyterian tutor, yet he took all occasions to be present
                at the sermons preached by the loyal divines in and near
                Oxford. In 1656, being then bachelor of arts, he received holy orders from the hands
                of Dr. Thomas Fulwar,
                bishop of Ardfert, or Kerry in Ireland; and was appointed
                preacher at Weston on the Green, near Bicester, in Oxfordshire; where he met with
                great encouragement from
                sir Francis Norris, lord of that manor. After he had taken
                his degree of M. A. he was presented to the vicarage of
                Leighton-Buzzard, in Bedfordshire; where he distinguished
                himself by his edifying manner of preaching, till 1662, when
                he went into Scotland, as chaplain to John earl of Middleton, the king’s high
                commissioner to the church of that
                kingdom. In the latter end of 1663, he was instituted to
                the Tolbooth church, at Edinburgh; and from thence was
                removed some years after to the Trone church of that
                city, which was likewise a prebend. In April 1676, he was
                nominated by the king to the deanery of Edinburgh; and
                in 1685 he commenced D. D. in the university of St. Andrews. He died June 13, 1689,
                and was honourably interred in the Grey-friars church at Edinburgh. As his
                life was pious and devout, so his sickness and death afforded great consolation to
                those who attended him in his
                last moments.

            <p>, confessor to Lewis <sc>XIV</sc>. was born at Rouergue, in 1590. He became a Jesuit
                in 1607, and professed the fourth vow in 1624. He taught philosophy at Toulouse six
                years, and divinity seven; and having discharged his duty in each of these
                capacities with great applause, he was invited to Rome, to act as censor-general of
                the books published by the Jesuits, and theologist to the general of the society.
                Upon his return to his own province, he was appointed rector of the colleges of
                Montpellier and of Toulouse. He assisted as deputy of his province at the eighth
                congregation-general of the Jesuits held at Rome in 1645, where he distinguished
                himself in such a manner, that father Vincent Caraffa, general of the Jesuits,
                thought no person more fit to discharge the office of assistant of France, which had
                been vacant for some time. The ninth congregation gave him the same post, under
                Francis Picolimini, general of the society, upon whose death he was made provincial
                of the province of France. Whilst he was engaged in this employment, he was chosen
                confessor to the king 1654; and after having discharged this office 16 years, he was
                obliged to solicit his dismission; his great age having much impaired his hearing.
                Father Sotueil, from whom these particulars are taken, gives him the character of a
                person of great virtues, perfect disinterestedness, modesty, and humility; exact in
                practising the observances and discipline of his order; extremely cautious in using
                his interest for his own advantage, or that of his family; and of uncommon zeal for
                religion. &lt;. He was the hammer of heretics,“<q>says he,</q>” and attacked
                particularly, with incredible zeal, the new heresy of the Jansenists. He strenuously
                endeavoured to get it condemned by the pope, and restrained by the authority of the
                king. Besides which, he confuted it with such strength of argument, that his
                adversaries had nothing solid to reply to him."<!--*BLOB*--> There are many (says Mr. Bayle) whom
                father Sotueil will never convince in this last point; but he seems to agree with
                him in the character of disinterestedness which he gives to Annat, who stirred so
                little for the advancement of his family, that the king is reported to have said, he
                knew not whether father Annat had any relations. </p>
            <p>Father Annat wrote several books, some in Latin, which
                were collected and published in three vols. 4to, Paris,
                1666; and others in bad French, mostly upon the disputes
                between the Jesuits and Jansenists. He died at Paris in
                1670.</p>

            <p>, a very eminent nonconformist minister, was the son of John Aneley, of Hareley, in
                Warwickshire, where his family were possessed of a good estate, and was born about
                the year 1620. In 1635 he was admitted a student in Queen’s college, Oxford, where
                he took his bachelor’s and master’s degrees. At the university he was distinguished
                by extreme temperance and industry. His inclination leading him to the church, he
                received holy orders, but it is uncertain whether from the hands of a bishop, or
                according to the Presbyterian way; Wood inclines to the former, and Calamy to the
                latter. In 1644, however, he became chaplain to the earl of Warwick, then admiral of
                the parliament’s fleet, and afterwards succeeded to a church at Clift'e, in Kent, by
                the ejectment, for loyalty, of Dr. Griffith Higges, who was much beloved by his
                parishioners. On July 26, 1648, he preached the fast sermon before the house of
                commons, which, as usual, was ordered to be printed. About this time, also, he was
                honoured with the title of <sc>LL</sc>. D. by the university of Oxford, or rather by
                the peremptory command of Philip earl of Pembroke, chancellor of the university, who
                acted there with boundless authority. The same year, he went to sea with the earl of
                Warwick, who was employed in giving chase to that part of the English navy which
                went over to the then prince, afterwards king Charles <sc>II</sc>. Some time after
                this, he resigned his Kentish living, although he had now become popular there, in
                consequence of a promise he made to his parishioners to “<q date="1657">resign it
                when he had fitted them for the
                    reception of a better minister.</q>” In <date event="work">1657</date>, he was
                nominated by Cromwell, lecturer at St. Paul’s; and in 1658 was presented by Richard,
                the protector, to the vicarage of St. Giles’s, Cripplegate. But this presentation
                becoming soon useless, he, in 1660, procured another from the trustees for the
                approbation and admission of ministers of the gospel, after the Presbyterian manner.
                His second presentation growing out of date as the first, he obtained, in the same
                year, a third, of a more legal stamp, from Charles <sc>II</sc>.; but in 1662, he was
                ejected for nonconformity. He was offered considerable preferment, if he would
                conform, but refused it, and continued to preach privately during that and the
                following reign. He died in 1696, with a high reputation for piety, charity, and
                popular talents. His works, which are enumerated by Calamy, consist of occasional
                sermons, and some funeral sermons, with biographical memoirs. He was the principal
                support, if not the institutor, of the morning lecture, or course of sermons
                preached at seven o'clock in the morning, at various churches, during the
                usurpation, and afterwards at meeting-houses, by the most learned and able
                nonconformists. Of these several volumes have been printed, and of late years have
                risen very much in price. Collectors inform us that a complete set should consist of
                six volumes.</p>

            <p>, a French historian, and ecclesiastical writer, was born in the Artois, in 1723, and
                became a Benedictine, but being appointed procurator of one of the houses of that
                order, he disappeared with the funds intrusted to his care. How he escaped
                afterwards, his biographer does not inform us, but he attached himself to the order
                of Malta, became an advocate of parliament, and doctor of laws of the faculty of
                Paris. He was afterwards made prior of Villeconin, and a member of the academies of
                Arras and of the arcades of Rome. He died about 1790, after having published: 1. “<q>Dialogues

            <p>, a celebrated French preacher, was born at Isle-en-Jourdain, a small town of
                Armagnac, Jan. 13, 1632; and first distinguished himself by odes and other poetical
                compositions, which were afterwards less esteemed. Being appointed tutor to the
                marquis D'Antin by his father the marquis Mentespan, Anselme removed to Paris, and
                acquired great fame in that metropolis by his sermons, and especially by his funeral
                orations. It was observed, however, that although elegant in style, they wanted much
                of that fervency which touches the heart. His noble pupil caused to be revived the
                place of historian of buildings, and bestowed it on Anselme; and the Academy of
                Painting, and that of Inscriptions and belles lettres, admitted him a member.
                Towards the close of life he retired to the abbey of St. Severe in Gascony, where he
                enjoyed the pleasures which his books and his garden afforded, and became a public
                benefactor; projecting new roads, decorating churches, founding hospitals, and by
                his discreet interposition, adjusting the differences which fell out among the
                country people. He died Aug. 18, 1737, in his ninety-sixth year. His works are a
                collection of “<q>Sermons, Panegyriques, &amp; Oraisontj Funebres,</q>” 7 vols. 8vo.
                The “<q>Sermons</q>” have been reprinted in 6 vols. 12mo. He has also several “<q>

                1622. In 1649 he travelled to Italy, where he acquired great reputation as a writer
                of Latin verse. Pope Innocent X. gave him a beautiful medal for a poem which he had
                composed on occasion of the jubilee celebrated in 165O, and queen Christina gave him
                a gold chain for a poem in Dutch which he addressed to her. Some have discovered in
                his poems an inclination for the Roman catholic religion. He died at Perouse in
                Italy, May 16, 1669. The collection of his works was printed at Rotterdam, 1715,

                Greek as far as it could be taught in his own, country, he went into Greece, and
                improved his acquaintance with that language under the ablest masters during a
                residence there of five years, and wrote and spoke Greek as easily as Latin or
                Italian. On his return to Mantua, he engaged in teaching the Greek language, and
                lectured on that and on Greek literature. In 1532 he was invited to Feirara, where
                he became professor of the same studies, and held the office until his death in
                1552. He translated Gemistus Plethon, and part of Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
                &amp;c. under the title “<q date="1540">Gemisti Plethonis de gestis Gnecorum post
                pugnam ad Mantineam per capita tractatio duobus
                    libris explicata, M. Antonio Antimacho interprete. Ad haec

                4to. He wrote also many Latin poems, which are mostly unpublished. Some have
                attributed to him eight books of Greek epigrams, and there are several by him, both
                in Greek and Latin, in a collection of letters addressed to Vettori, and published
                by Bandini, at Pavia, 1753.</p>
